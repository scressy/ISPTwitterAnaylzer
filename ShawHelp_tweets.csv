2017-11-10 13:56:28,"Hi Danny! Just want to check, is your service with Shaw Cable, or Shaw Direct? ^TF"

2017-11-10 12:49:50,"It might help to power cycle your box, and then set up the recording again. New should be the default. ^TF"
2017-11-10 12:45:12,Thanks! Do you know if it's set to record new episodes only? ^TF
2017-11-10 12:39:33,"Oh that's super weird! Are you setting up the recording via voice command, or through the guide? ^TF"
2017-11-10 12:27:46,"Awww, I'm glad she was able to help you out, Jean! I'll make sure to pass this along to Rebecca. ^TF"

2017-11-10 11:54:29,We certainly don't want to lose you as a customer. Feel free to send us a DM w/ your account info and we can continue the conversation. ^TF
2017-11-10 11:49:46,"It's probably less expensive to run a cable from the Hitron, rather than adding a secondary Internet account. ^TF"
2017-11-10 11:49:12,"Ok, thanks! So in that case, the options provided by the rep you spoke to earlier are correct. ^TF"
2017-11-10 11:44:56,"We don't do custom wiring, but if there is an outlet near the tv, we can book a tech to have the Hitron moved. Do you want to do that? ^TF"
2017-11-10 11:41:09,"It's not something that can be enabled. The Gateway doesn't function as a modem, so you'll need to connect to the Hitron. ^TF"
2017-11-10 11:34:21,"The port on the Gateway is disabled, so unfortunately it won't work for a direct connection. ^TF"
2017-11-10 11:30:04,"Thanks! If it's a cable box, it will not supply Internet, so it needs to be connected to the Hitron if you want a direct connection. ^TF"
2017-11-10 11:26:07,"When you say Arris, are you referring to your Gateway box? (Arris also makes modems, so just want to be sure.) ^TF"
2017-11-10 11:19:10,"Hi Gord, we can see if we can help with that. What brand is the TV? ^TF"
2017-11-10 11:15:20,"Hi Roman, we can look into this for you! Can you please send us a DM with the phone #and address on your account? Thanks! ^TF"
2017-11-10 10:56:15,"Thanks! It could be a WiFi interference problem, but we can take a closer look if you DM the phone #and address on the account. ^TF"
2017-11-10 10:52:38,"Hey Marc! We can take a look. Is it just dropping over WiFi or a wired connection, too? ^TF"
2017-11-10 10:46:15,"Oh, sorry, also meant to send you this link as it has some more information about troubleshooting slow speeds https:// community.shaw.ca/docs/DOC-1012 ^TF"
2017-11-10 10:44:24,"If the issue comes back, please feel free to send us a DM with the account information and we can take a closer look. Thanks! ^TF"
2017-11-10 10:44:03,Resetting the modem is usually the first step we suggest. Sometimes a modem just needs to be power cycled to get things going again. ^TF
2017-11-10 10:37:23,"Ok, no worries. We can help out. To start, what results are you getting when you run a speed test? ^TF"
2017-11-10 10:33:54,Hello! Slow speeds can be caused by a number of different factors. We can take a closer look. Have you done any troubleshooting so far? ^TF
2017-11-10 10:25:10,"As per the info in the Community document, it will not affect direct speeds and your home WiFi network traffic will be prioritized. ^TF"
2017-11-10 10:18:33,"Hi Michael, this only applies to residential modems. ^TF"
2017-11-10 10:05:59,"Hey William! That's definitely a phishing attempt, so you're good to ignore it. Thanks for the heads up! ^TF"

2017-11-10 08:41:50,"Hi Julee, nothing reported for that area. I just reset your modem for you. Can you test it again in 5 minutes? Thanks! ^TF"

2017-11-10 08:05:09,"The speed at which it downloads can also depend on the server, and whether or not you're using Internet on other devices as well. ^TF"

2017-11-09 20:05:59,"Try 1, 6 or 11, as they have the least overlap; leave it on one of those chs for a while and test. ^Ken"
2017-11-09 20:00:24,"Hey Terry, while there's some ( http:// bit.ly/2og19XN ) not all eps are always available as they have limited time due to licensing ^Ken"
2017-11-09 19:57:12,"Hmm, there are mobile apps (android/ios) that can see what the best wifi channel for you to use, that would be best way to check ^Ken"
2017-11-09 19:50:43,"Thanks for working with us in troubleshooting, let us know how it goes w/ channel adjustment if no improvement ^Ken"

2017-11-09 19:17:53,"Hmm, nothing so far; can you plz confirm if modem's online (should be 4 solid lights from the top)? ^Ken"
2017-11-09 19:12:37,"Thanks for narrowing it down, may just be that 1 Portal that is having the issue ^Ken"
2017-11-09 19:12:16,No reports at this time; is modem online (first 4 lights should be solid) or any of them blinking? ^Ken

2017-11-05 16:49:01,"Hello Jason. That is correct, you would need to bring in the old rental modem to swap it for the new one. ^LD"
2017-11-05 16:44:21,Hi Melissa. Netflix is not required to access any of our VOD content. It would only be needed to access anything in the Netflix library. ^LD
2017-11-05 15:38:51,"Hi Laura. We expect our techs to drive safe and courteously, to set the example. Could you DM more details please? ^Lance"

2017-11-05 15:17:23,Hi Kayla. Are you near Glastonbury area? Outage due to some of our equipment being in Hydro outage. Waiting on power to come back. ^Lance
2017-11-05 15:11:41,Hi Justin. Nothing that I'm seeing. Could you DM your address please? I can get more info for you. ^Lance
2017-11-05 14:51:55,"Hi Travis. If you'd like me to look at your account and look at options for you, please follow and DM. ^Lance"
2017-11-05 14:44:27,"Hi Jessy. The price is set with the broadcaster. And since it's a set price, there is no monthly rate. If you want it, it is $129. ^Lance"
2017-11-05 14:35:43,"Feel free to DM us if restarting phone, forgetting and reconnecting to Passpoint doesn't work. We can always send you up as example! ^Lance"
2017-11-05 14:33:30,"That's right, you should be able to connect to both ShawOpen and Passpoint through the same login. ^Lance"
2017-11-05 14:29:03,"Hmm, should work then. But we're getting reports of Passpoint rejecting some iPhones. Does phone have all updates? ^Lance"
2017-11-05 14:24:33,"Hey KK, what kind of phone do you have? Shawpoint only works with iPhones at this time. Some Androids but not most. ^Lance"
2017-11-05 14:22:35,"That might be okay since it's shipped from the warehouse, not retail. If stock is too low, they'll let you know. ^Lance"
2017-11-05 14:14:51,"Ah, that's because we're focusing on BlueSky TV. Any Gateways in stock would be at the warehouse for service call swaps. ^Lance"
2017-11-05 14:09:17,"If they know the serial number of the box they will purchase, they can reach out to us & we should be able to identify the warranty ^Harvey"
2017-11-05 14:03:49,Ah! No worries. :) ^Harvey
2017-11-05 14:03:27,"So if the box was purchased last year originally, and your friend got it now, would have 2 yr remaining. If 2 yr ago, then 1 yr. Etc ^Harvey"
2017-11-05 14:02:46,New boxes have a 3 year warranty and refurbished units would take on the warranty from the period it was purchased. (1/2) ^Harvey
2017-11-05 14:02:04,Yeah! If you to Sportsnet Go or TSN TV site online you should be able to log into access Live TV. ^Harvey
2017-11-05 13:58:42,And I believe the games would work from their app! 2/2 ^Harvey
2017-11-05 13:58:24,Hey Spencer! There are some blackout restrictions http:// bit.ly/1OeTcaE You could download the app of the provider (TSN/SN GO) 1/2 ^Harvey
2017-11-05 13:57:14,"Got you! Yeah, if they have a Pace/Motorola PVR hooking up a Gateway system shouldn't affect those boxes or recordings. ^Harvey"
2017-11-05 13:47:57,That depends on the other PVRs you may have. Could you send me your acct info via DM? I can see if its possible or not. ^Harvey

2017-11-05 12:51:59,^Lance pic.twitter.com/EuWuTws8xJ
2017-11-05 12:51:44,That's odd. Could you send a DM and confirm your address or account number? Let's take a look from this side. ^Lance
2017-11-05 12:46:30,"Ah, that's not good. :( Hopefully just a quick overnight blip. Let us know if it happens again. ^Lance"
2017-11-05 12:42:41,Might be one not reported yet. Could you DM your address please? I'd like to take a look into this for you. ^Lance
2017-11-05 12:38:16,Hi Boss. No issues reported in your area. What issues are you having? ^Lance
2017-11-05 12:33:24,"Hi Teddy. NHL Network was discontinued by the broadcaster on September 1, 2015. It is no more. ^Lance"
2017-11-05 12:31:57,"Hmm, has the full guide downloaded yet? Swirl might be indicating that it can't find anything to record yet. ^Lance"
2017-11-05 12:30:44,It might have been updates that were slowing things down too. I did that large Windows update and it slowed down my whole network. ^Lance
2017-11-05 12:29:45,Best to send a DM. Then we can look at getting you a service call. ^Lance
2017-11-05 12:12:49,Hi Shady. Pulling the power cord usually works. Could you reconnect coaxial cable on the back of it then power cycle the once? ^Lance
2017-11-05 12:12:08,Hi Michael. Definitely credit you for time without services. Please follow and DM and I can take a look. ^Lance
2017-11-05 11:58:20,It can take a few minutes. ^Lance
2017-11-05 11:51:20,"Hi Lost. Yikes, tried to change time and got confused. Could you pull its power cord for 10 seconds, give it a quick reboot please? ^Lance"
2017-11-05 11:22:34,Previews and promos on specific channels or packages are under agreement with broadcaster. We can't do it for NFLST. Plz DM to order. ^Lance
2017-11-05 11:20:16,"Sorry, we aren't able to offer any previews on it. We can only add it with one payment. ^Lance"

2017-11-05 10:46:07,Hi Rich. Let's take a look at your signal. Could you follow and DM your address pleae? Thanks! ^Lance
2017-11-05 10:27:59,We don't control what broadcaster decides to show. We only relay it from them to you. Tweeting the channel directly might be useful! ^Lance
2017-11-05 10:20:32,Frustration understood! Sometimes it's just tweaking wifi channels or maybe a service call. Please DM and we can take a look. ^Lance
2017-11-05 10:01:52,Let me know when you're ready to troubleshoot. I know that dogs must come first! ^Lance

2017-11-05 09:53:24,"Hi John. Games played depend on the broadcaster, what they think will sell and what they can license. What channel was that? ^Lance"
2017-11-05 09:50:28,"Hi Kramer. Good troubleshooting! If you could follow and DM your address, let's look at signal to modem now too. ^Lance"
2017-11-05 09:48:01,"Hi Jennifer. If channels keep cutting out, would be signal to digital box. Could you DM your account info please? Let's rake a look. ^Lance"

2017-11-05 09:40:49,Good morning. We’d like to apologize for the issue surrounding last night’s UFC 217 event. Please DM us with acct info. ^Phil
2017-11-05 09:32:21,"Hi Jen. Do you notice any difference if you test other wifi channels? 1, 6 and 11 are the optimum ones. http:// bit.ly/wifichan ^Lance"
2017-11-05 09:31:02,"Hi Damian. If it's still buffering this morning, one way to test would be longer movie at Youtube or other video site. ^Lance"
2017-11-05 09:29:27,Hi Steve. Sorry for last night's issue. There won't be a charge if you are on BlueSky TV. ^Lance

2017-11-05 08:51:21,"Hi Rob. It only affected BlueSky TV customers. If you could send us a DM, we can look at signal issues on your own boxes. ^Lance"
2017-11-05 08:47:41,Hi Liz. We definitely wouldn't send out an email like that. It would be phishing. ^Lance
2017-11-05 08:46:29,Good morning! ^Lance
2017-11-05 08:32:39,Hi Spencer. Sorry for last night's issue. Not to worry about charge. ^Lance
