2017-11-24 19:54:40,"If it's only happening to one of a few in your home, can you DM us the serial number so that I can take a look? If haven't tried, rebooting it should usually solve odd quirks that you see. ^Ken"
2017-11-24 19:48:05,"Hmm, just the one cable box that's affected? Or if you have multiples, same issue on that channel across all TVs? ^Ken"
2017-11-24 19:47:20,"Instead of using OBS, have you tried going through YouTube directly or tried alternative programs? Unfortunately , this is a bit out of our support scope. ^Ken"
2017-11-24 19:30:15,Hey Arlene! Would you be able to give me some context as to what's happening please? ^Ken
2017-11-24 19:20:51,"Hey Lianne, correct on channel 302/326! ^Ken"
2017-11-24 19:19:21,Sorry to hear that it's still occurring. Example would be best referred to YouTube's support to see if there are other settings/optimizations available for OBS. ^Ken
2017-11-24 19:11:33,Sorry to hear! Any error messages shown on screen? All TVs in home or just a specific one? ^Ken
2017-11-24 18:54:55,"I think he rotates between multiples of the same shirt; but then again, being the fire dude is a full-time gig, no time to change clothes on some nights :) ^Ken"
2017-11-24 18:48:57,"Factory reset would revert any custom settings that you had back to factory defaults. If ok with that, hold pinhole reset button at back of modem for at least 45s before letting go. ^Ken"

2017-11-24 18:29:01,"Results look fine; would suggest rebooting modem if haven't tried. Factory reset may be needed to see if that helps improve. Area wise, nothing at this time suggesting upload saturation. ^Ken"
2017-11-24 18:23:58,"Do you have any trace routes to YouTube? Also, troubleshooting wise so far, what has been tried? Aside from this, is normal browsing ok? ^Ken"
2017-11-24 18:14:45,What services are you streaming to specifically? Do you have any trace routes collected? Tried adjusting bitrate settings? ^Ken

2017-11-24 18:03:46,"Hey Quinn, was this while on a wireless or wired connection? ^Ken"
2017-11-24 17:57:18,"No saturation issues present in your area Robert. We do recommend that you give the direct connection a try, to rule out router affecting your connection. Let us know how it goes after trying, give us a shout back anytime! ^Ken"
2017-11-24 17:38:35,"I recommend that you try a direct connection, comp to modem only, and try to recreate the issue/observe during your reported time, to see if any changes/improvements. ^Ken"
2017-11-24 17:25:19,"Troubleshooting wise, what has been tried so far? Are you using own router for sharing the internet in the home (wireless)? ^Ken"

2017-11-24 15:14:32,Sometimes the IP address received on a cellular connection will show you connecting from another city/province. Can you try a WIFI connection? ^DH

2017-11-24 14:33:04,Sounds like it may be an issue with the channel itself. We'll have someone tune to the channel and monitor

2017-11-24 12:36:36,"Thanks for the update. If it starts acting up again, let us know! ^SJ"
2017-11-24 12:31:58,"Interesting, could have been a intermittent blip but also different browsers and test platforms handle data differently. Sometimes it is best to use different browser and/or testing sites."
2017-11-24 12:30:18,Were the first and last speed tests from http:// speedtest.net ? What browser are you testing from?

2017-11-17 14:55:00,Hi Kyoko. I can definitely pass on some kudos for you! I found your account info over DM and found Stacey too. I'm forwarding your tweet on to her and her supervisor now! ^Lance
2017-11-17 14:24:50,We're also here on social media if you ever have any questions! Feel free to give us a shout... or whatever the equivalent is in typing ;) Have a great day! ^TF
2017-11-17 12:23:47,"Perfect, thanks for the heads up! It might have just needed a few minutes to completely reset. Hopefully it's all good now, though! Let us know if we can help with anything else :) ^TF"
2017-11-17 12:18:18,"Great, thanks! Can you try unplugging the power on the box for about 30 seconds, then plug it back in? It may just need a reset to get back online. If that doesn't work, please let us know. ^TF"
2017-11-17 12:13:43,Hey Scott! We can take a look. Are any of your other services down as well? ^TF

2017-11-17 09:46:02,"Thanks! So it's probably the router, not the modem. Did you try power cycling both devices? That may help, so it's worth a try. You can find detailed steps here: https:// community.shaw.ca/docs/DOC-1058 ^TF"
2017-11-17 09:44:16,"Not necessarily. If it's a problem with your router, then changing the modem won't make a difference. When the connection drops, do the lights on the front of the modem shut off? ^TF"
2017-11-17 09:41:02,Oh perfect! Thanks for letting us know. Feel free to message again if we can help with anything else. Have a great day! ^TF
2017-11-17 09:39:46,"Thanks! That's a wired modem, so the Apple Airport would be your router. Try unplugging both devices, then plug in the modem first. Wait a minute or so, then plug in the Apple Airport as that may help get the WiFi going again. if not, please let us know. ^TF"
2017-11-17 09:31:04,"Do you have your own router? If you have a separate router, then the steps would be different. You can check the user manual or search online depending on the brand. ^TF"
2017-11-17 09:27:36,"Hello! If it's just WiFi that is dropping, it's probably interference from other devices. Changing your WiFi channel should help if that's the case. https:// community.shaw.ca/docs/DOC-1046 has the steps on how to do that - may need to test a few to see which one works best. ^TF"
2017-11-17 09:18:19,Thanks! Can you please send us a DM with the phone #and address on the account? We can check to see if there is an area issue. ^TF
2017-11-17 09:05:55,"Hi Keith, I'm not seeing any reported issues for Burnaby right now. Have you done any troubleshooting so far? If not, I'd start with power cycling the modem as that usually gets things going again. If not, please let us know. Thanks! ^TF"

2017-11-17 08:03:42,"Oh no! That's definitely frustrating. It sounds like it's probably a signal issue. Have you tried checking your coax cable connections to make sure they're tight? If not, that's where I would start. Let us know if that doesn't fix it. Thanks! ^TF"

2017-11-14 10:05:03,"Sometimes the channels will have additional episodes available on their website, so that might be worth checking out if you missed any. ^TF"
2017-11-14 10:04:44,"Availability of episodes is determined by the networks themselves - they own the rights, so that's not something that we can modify. ^TF"
2017-11-14 10:03:14,"No problem! I'm not 100% sure that's the channel this year, but we should have more holiday information available soon. ^TF"
2017-11-14 10:00:43,"Do you have a PVR? If you do, it may be better to record them to ensure that you don't miss any. Sorry about that! ^TF"
2017-11-14 10:00:21,"The amount of time the episodes are available depend on the license from the network, so unfortunately we can't control that. ^TF"
2017-11-14 09:57:44,Just trying to get confirmation but I believe it may be on 427 (same as last year). ^TF
2017-11-14 09:45:36,"Hi Pat, the delay on episodes can vary based on the network. Is there a specific show you're looking for? ^TF"

2017-11-10 11:44:56,"We don't do custom wiring, but if there is an outlet near the tv, we can book a tech to have the Hitron moved. Do you want to do that? ^TF"
2017-11-10 11:41:09,"It's not something that can be enabled. The Gateway doesn't function as a modem, so you'll need to connect to the Hitron. ^TF"

2017-11-05 14:44:27,"Hi Jessy. The price is set with the broadcaster. And since it's a set price, there is no monthly rate. If you want it, it is $129. ^Lance"
2017-11-05 14:35:43,"Feel free to DM us if restarting phone, forgetting and reconnecting to Passpoint doesn't work. We can always send you up as example! ^Lance"

2017-11-05 14:29:03,"Hmm, should work then. But we're getting reports of Passpoint rejecting some iPhones. Does phone have all updates? ^Lance"
2017-11-05 14:24:33,"Hey KK, what kind of phone do you have? Shawpoint only works with iPhones at this time. Some Androids but not most. ^Lance"
2017-11-05 14:22:35,"That might be okay since it's shipped from the warehouse, not retail. If stock is too low, they'll let you know. ^Lance"
2017-11-05 14:14:51,"Ah, that's because we're focusing on BlueSky TV. Any Gateways in stock would be at the warehouse for service call swaps. ^Lance"
2017-11-05 14:09:17,"If they know the serial number of the box they will purchase, they can reach out to us & we should be able to identify the warranty ^Harvey"
2017-11-05 14:03:49,Ah! No worries. :) ^Harvey
2017-11-05 14:03:27,"So if the box was purchased last year originally, and your friend got it now, would have 2 yr remaining. If 2 yr ago, then 1 yr. Etc ^Harvey"
2017-11-05 14:02:46,New boxes have a 3 year warranty and refurbished units would take on the warranty from the period it was purchased. (1/2) ^Harvey
2017-11-05 14:02:04,Yeah! If you to Sportsnet Go or TSN TV site online you should be able to log into access Live TV. ^Harvey
2017-11-05 13:58:42,And I believe the games would work from their app! 2/2 ^Harvey
2017-11-05 13:58:24,Hey Spencer! There are some blackout restrictions http:// bit.ly/1OeTcaE You could download the app of the provider (TSN/SN GO) 1/2 ^Harvey
2017-11-05 13:57:14,"Got you! Yeah, if they have a Pace/Motorola PVR hooking up a Gateway system shouldn't affect those boxes or recordings. ^Harvey"
2017-11-05 13:47:57,That depends on the other PVRs you may have. Could you send me your acct info via DM? I can see if its possible or not. ^Harvey

2017-11-05 12:33:24,"Hi Teddy. NHL Network was discontinued by the broadcaster on September 1, 2015. It is no more. ^Lance"
2017-11-05 12:31:57,"Hmm, has the full guide downloaded yet? Swirl might be indicating that it can't find anything to record yet. ^Lance"
2017-11-05 12:30:44,It might have been updates that were slowing things down too. I did that large Windows update and it slowed down my whole network. ^Lance
2017-11-05 12:29:45,Best to send a DM. Then we can look at getting you a service call. ^Lance
2017-11-05 12:12:49,Hi Shady. Pulling the power cord usually works. Could you reconnect coaxial cable on the back of it then power cycle the once? ^Lance
2017-11-05 12:12:08,Hi Michael. Definitely credit you for time without services. Please follow and DM and I can take a look. ^Lance

2017-11-05 10:27:59,We don't control what broadcaster decides to show. We only relay it from them to you. Tweeting the channel directly might be useful! ^Lance
2017-11-05 10:20:32,Frustration understood! Sometimes it's just tweaking wifi channels or maybe a service call. Please DM and we can take a look. ^Lance

2017-11-05 08:47:41,Hi Liz. We definitely wouldn't send out an email like that. It would be phishing. ^Lance

2017-10-25 19:16:51,The best way to determine this is to compare the results to a wired speed test. If wired speeds are low we can investigate further. ^TF
2017-10-25 19:13:36,"You can find the steps to do that here if needed: https:// community.shaw.ca/docs/DOC-1046 Best channel can vary, so I'd suggest testing out a few. ^TF"
2017-10-25 19:12:54,"Most of the time you can resolve slow WiFi speeds by changing the wireless channel, so I'd recommend starting there. ^TF"
2017-10-25 19:12:11,"So if your wired speeds are good, then we can focus on troubleshooting the wireless connection to see if it can be improved. ^TF"
2017-10-25 19:11:33,"Thanks! The reason we ask if it's WiFi is because it's more susceptible to issues, like interference from other devices and networks. ^TF"

2017-10-25 19:03:33,The internet would go down briefly but it shouldn't affect your cable signal. Is that result over WiFi again? ^TF
2017-10-25 18:59:19,"Great, thank you! Hopefully that does the trick. If not, please feel free to send us a DM so we can troubleshoot further. ^TF"
2017-10-25 18:58:08,You're welcome! Feel free to message again if we can help with anything else. Have a good night! ^TF

2017-07-19 18:50:23,Great! Do you know if it's active? ^TF
2017-07-19 18:45:55,That depends on whether or not there is an outlet upstairs. Is there a cable outlet upstairs? ^TF
2017-07-19 18:41:55,"If that's not possible, you can try changing your wireless channel on the router. The manual should have instructions for that. ^TF"
2017-07-19 18:41:27,Thanks! I'd recommend using a wired connection if you can for gaming. Wired connections tend to be more stable than WiFi. ^TF

2017-07-13 21:48:00,"Hey Cav. That is the digital box going into Offline Mode, which can be caused by signal issues. If you follow and DM we can check. ^LD"

2017-07-13 20:05:40,Have a good night! ^LD
2017-07-13 20:00:03,That is something we can definitely take care of. If resenting the cable ends doesn't help we may need to arrange for a tech. ^LD
2017-07-13 19:59:56,"Have you rebooted the modem? We see it online for the past 6 days straight. If it does occur, reboot both and let us know how it goes. ^Ken"

2017-07-13 19:01:11,"I would try bypassing it as a test, go comp direct to modem, http:// bit.ly/1lEHF8n , no issues w/ your modem at this time. ^Ken"

2017-07-13 14:34:54,"Were you streaming at the time? Bear in mind, when streaming it's uploading = using your bandwidth, and will look slower than it is ^TB"
2017-07-13 14:26:40,"Can you pop me a DM? I suspect I know what the issue is, but will need to take a look at your account. ^TB"
2017-07-13 14:06:54,"Might be wifi interference on the modem's channel frequency. Does it improve if you try channels 1, 6, 11? http:// bit.ly/wifichan ^Lance"

2017-07-13 12:33:25,Then you can test out other WiFi channels to see which works best. Can find the steps for that here: https:// community.shaw.ca/docs/DOC-1046 ^TF
2017-07-13 12:33:02,You'll want to do this for 10 seconds or so. This will wipe out any custom setting so may need to set that up again afterwards. ^TF
2017-07-13 12:32:40,"Thanks! I would recommend 2 things: a factory reset, and changing the WiFi channel. To reset, hold down reset button on back of modem. ^TF"

2017-07-07 08:13:09,Good morning! We can take a look at this for you. Is this happening over WiFi only? ^TF

2017-07-06 21:24:50,"Sounds like a poor signal to the box. Unscrew the cable ends, off the box and off the cable outlet, then screw them back on and check. ^LD"
2017-07-06 21:23:14,Hey Ross. No issues in the area. Are you getting pixelation on screen as well? ^LD

2017-07-06 21:10:39,"Hm, I see. So actual show time is 6-7pm but the guide is incorrectly showing as 6:30-7:30pm is what you're saying, right? ^EL"
2017-07-06 21:05:03,Hey Daniel! We do have techs on site working to restore svc for Marathon this evening. Appreciate your patience with this! ^EL
2017-07-06 21:00:16,"If it's only happening for that one show, maybe it has something to do with a setting that went wrong while being set up? ^EL"
2017-07-06 20:59:49,"Strange. Have you tried completely deleting the existing recording that you've set up, and redoing it? ^EL"
2017-07-06 20:52:16,Hey happy to help with this. Is it only happening for that specific show? Other recordings are fine? ^EL

2017-07-03 15:47:38,There wouldn't be anything in system that would block updates. My Android phone updates thru my wifi. Could you follow/DM address? ^Lance
2017-07-03 15:37:43,"Hmm, that's odd that it would only be the one thing that's affected. Have you restarted your phone yet? ^Lance"

2017-07-03 13:04:40,"It also depends on placement of modem. Higher shelf is better, also away from phone, speaker, TV, etc. ^Lance"
2017-07-03 12:55:02,"Yeah, walls are a killer for wifi. Concrete absorbs the signal, metal deflects it. ^Lance"
2017-07-03 12:51:37,"Might be wifi interference. Shaw wifi modem? Test it on channels 1,6,11. One might be better than others. http:// bit.ly/wifichan ^Lance"

2017-06-23 16:22:00,Our techs can only run cables outside the home and drill in For running cables through walls that would need a third party contractor ^JB
2017-06-23 16:19:11,Likely that outlet is still active so you could just take the modem and cables up to that outlet and should work ^JB
2017-06-23 16:13:42,Talk to IT for that and moving your modem from one floor in your home to another? ^JB
2017-06-23 16:08:52,Oh if it is working we don't need to try anything! Should be good from here ^JB
2017-06-23 16:07:13,"That would be great, next we will want to try running some tests ^JB"

2017-05-29 19:59:03,Thanks! So it might be a bit of a signal issue. Does the coax on the back go straight from the box to the wall?Or through splitter first?^BE
2017-05-29 19:59:00,Hey Skippynixx. There is a volume range that shows can use for emphases. Our commercials however we just keep it at an even volume. ^LD

2017-05-22 19:38:26,Hey there! Are you sure it's in 720p? Do you have your cable box to output at 1080p? I believe it should be in 1080p on VOD. ^BE
2017-05-22 19:36:11,It is a volume range. Shows use the range for effect where as commercials often use full volume which is what can make them sound loud. ^LD

2017-05-22 11:44:12,Hi Sean. Sportsnet was never part of Limited TV. That's just the bare bones package. Maybe you had Personal TV or Basic TV? ^Lance
2017-05-22 11:27:57,"Hey, Phil knows his place. I threaten to withhold morning coffee privileges and he falls into line. ^Lance ( ∙_∙ ) ( ∙_∙ )>⌐■-■ (⌐■_■)"

2017-05-21 21:47:55,"These troubleshooting steps will also help with intermittent sound issues, as it's likely a poor signal coming through to cable box ^BE"

2017-05-20 10:00:41,"I recommend rebooting modem/router first, most likely fix. If same issues and using own router, try direct cnx (comp to modem only) ^Ken"
2017-05-20 09:56:35,"No issues at this time. What specific network issues? Troubleshooting wise, what have you tried? ^Ken"

2017-05-19 21:47:54,"Might be something new in the area causing wifi interference. Try the modem is wifi channels 1, 6 or 11, see which one is strongest. ^Lance"
2017-05-19 21:42:14,Hi Lorin. Lower speeds could be due to a number of things. Is this over wifi or direct to modem? How many computers online at a time? ^Lance

2017-05-16 16:52:53,"Hard wired connection, so with your PC you will log in, not over WIFI. ^LD"
2017-05-16 16:46:49,Log into the modem as per the directions I forwarded http:// bit.ly/13VEoo1 ^LD
2017-05-16 16:44:23,"That's very odd. Right now the modem is showing both are active. Try logging in and changing the wireless channel, see if it shows up. ^LD"

2017-05-16 16:22:21,I don't believe it is compatible with any 3rd party remotes. Unlikely you'd want to use a different remote once you try it. ^DH

2017-05-16 16:11:04,Looks like the modem is online. Have you already tried pulling power out for a moment? Do you use a 3rd party router? ^LD

2017-05-01 15:00:13,Good to hear! ^Lance
2017-05-01 15:00:11,"Yeah, it was odd that no issues were showing. Must have been our teams having to take cables offline while they work. ^Lance"

2017-05-01 12:14:07,Hi Tewha. What issues are you having? I find that turning wifi off and back on will help with the connection. ^Lance

2017-05-01 09:32:08,Just confirming: does it seem to be working now? ^TF
2017-05-01 09:32:07,No worries! Sometimes a quick reset is all it needs. You can also do that by unplugging the modem for 30 seconds. ^TF
2017-05-01 09:28:07,"Yup, internet only is fine. With TV we don't usually do self-installs, so that's really the main difference. ^TF"

2017-05-01 09:07:07,Yup! In most cases we can do self install for internet. Should be an option on the order form on the website for that. ^TF

2017-04-27 10:22:07,"If you have an older Gateway, then the pin hole reset is correct. Newer Gateways you can just hold down the power button for 4s."
2017-04-27 10:07:07,"Thanks! When you reset the Gateway, did you hold down the pin hole button on the back? Or just power cycled? ^TF"

2017-04-27 09:43:08,"Hmmn, any chance it's a Gateway? Do you have an error message on screen? ^TF"

2017-04-27 09:19:07,"No worries! Hopefully that does the trick, but if not, we can always take a closer look. ^TF"

2017-04-27 09:13:08,"Sometimes it helps to unplug Gateway, then unscrew the coax cable from box/splitter/outlet and then reconnect. ^TF"
2017-04-27 09:13:07,"Ah, ok! Could also be a loose cable connection. Try checking to make sure the coax connections are all tight. ^TF"

2017-04-27 09:04:07,"No worries! Usually we just start with the easiest step, which is to unplug the power on the main Gateway box for 30 seconds ^TF"
2017-04-27 08:52:10,"Sure, we can take a look! Have you done any troubleshooting so far, like resetting the Gateway? ^TF"
2017-04-27 08:43:07,Ha! I didn't even notice that. Should have worked on an opener with more alliteration. Next time! :D ^TF

2017-04-26 14:30:10,Have you tried resetting the modem? If it's an internet issue this might help. You can unplug it for 30 seconds to reset. ^TF
2017-04-26 13:04:07,You can find the steps to do that here: https:// community.shaw.ca/docs/DOC-1046 May need to test a few to see which works best ^TF
2017-04-26 13:02:08,"Ok, no problem! If it's WiFi only, it may just be interference. In that case, changing the WiFi channel should help. ^TF"
2017-04-26 12:54:07,We can take a look! Is this happening over WiFi only or does it affect a direct wired connection? ^TF

2017-04-24 20:51:41,With wifi slight fluctuations can happen from time to time(due to environmental interference) but should be all good if upload is fixed!^EL
2017-04-24 20:49:30,I vote Shaw! :D Feel free to DM if you have any questions for us at: @Shawhelp ^Eva
2017-04-24 20:42:23,Have you tried unplugging the power+coax cables from both ends for 20 seconds yet? That'd be a good start to troubleshooting the speeds^EL
2017-04-24 20:37:54,Sounds good! If still no luck there are some other things that we can try^EL
2017-04-24 20:34:40,Yea 5G is usually the better one to go with! Let's have you try a pinhole reset on the modem to see if that'll bump up the upload speeds^EL
2017-04-24 20:30:04,Darn ok. Thx for trying! D'you know if you're connected to the 2.4 or 5G network? You can also try changing from 2.4 to 5G or vice versa^EL
2017-04-24 20:18:12,"Hey! Are you noticing these speeds on wifi, or while you're wired in directly?^EL"
2017-04-24 20:17:23,"Ok, keep us posted on how it goes!^EL"
2017-04-24 20:17:00,"Hm, and this was after unplugging the power+coax cables from both ends? Or have you not had a chance to try that yet?^EL"
2017-04-24 20:15:16,"I see. To boost speeds, always worth a shot to start by unplugging the power+coax cables from both ends (wait 20secs). See if that helps!^EL"
2017-04-24 20:12:22,Glad to hear you're back up and running! Hope you have a great evening^EL
2017-04-24 20:12:06,"Hey Jill, happy to help! Did you run the speedtest on wifi, or while wired in directly?^EL"

2017-04-23 17:46:31,Looks like some other devices may be using your connection as well causing that. Try pulling power out for a moment and test again. ^LD

2017-04-23 17:30:57,It would have required landlord authorization to install so shouldn't affect any damage deposit. Is this in an apartment? ^LD
2017-04-23 17:24:29,"Most SD boxes don't have power save feature. Is it plugged into a power outlet or a power bar? If in a power bar, try plugging it direct.^LD"

2017-04-23 17:10:15,"No that wouldn't affect it, if other devices are connecting, it will affect the speed results. Do you have other devices connected? ^LD"
2017-04-23 17:08:58,The digital box will record any set recordings even when turned off. The only time it wouldn't is if it is unplugged or disconnected. ^LD

2017-04-22 10:27:05,re:5g wifi.. not all devices are capable of using it. Usually old equip/laptops. Best to make sure ur devices can use 5g
2017-04-22 10:25:29,personal experience: hardwired to modem is around 170 while wifi in my house can average 80-100 on 5g wifi
2017-04-22 10:23:53,that in itself would improve wifi speeds because 2.4 is commonly used and is congested. Most household devices use 2.4 like cordless phones
2017-04-22 10:23:28,"For the small price difference and the rate guarantee. I would say it is definitely worth it. Also, you'd likely be using a mdm w/5g wifi"
2017-04-22 09:54:25,"Yes, it is possible as there usually be more traffic/usage in the evening. Best is to test hardwired to modem for most accurate results"
2017-04-22 09:52:35,"None that I see, can you send me a DM w/acc#so I can investigate further Omar? Thx ^SJ"
2017-04-22 09:31:46,"Jim, can you send me a DM w/acc info so I can have a closer look? ^SJ"

2017-04-22 09:01:07,Just taking a look.. can u unplug modem and router for 1 minute? Plug modem back to power then router 1 min after. should wrk then
2017-04-22 08:58:17,"Odd, should let it go through since we're a business profile. I followed you now, can you pls try again? ^SJ"
2017-04-22 08:48:07,Sorry for the trouble this morning. We're working on a fix. Info at http:// bit.ly/2pQchvL

2017-04-20 17:18:07,"That's ok, no need to remove the splitter. Can you disconnect & reconnect the cable connections to the splitter? ^DH"

2017-04-20 14:13:17,Do you notice this on all channels in FreeRange or a specific one? Are VOD titles on FreeRange glitchy too or just live TV? ^HG
2017-04-20 14:05:55,"Hmm, haven't heard much reports on that, all devices or certain one? Does uninstall/reinstall help? ^Ken"
2017-04-20 13:49:08,"Hold time can vary based on how busy we are, so ten minutes isn't necessarily a cause for concern. Was that today? ^TF"
2017-04-20 13:47:07,"What sort of troubleshooting have you done so far? Do you have other services with us, and if so, are they down, too? ^TF"
2017-04-20 13:46:07,"If there is another number you may have used to register the account, try entering that. We can also help with troubleshooting"

2017-04-20 13:17:07,Hmmn. Sometimes it helps to delete the profile & re-register. Something might not be authenticating properly so that may fix.
2017-04-20 13:03:07,"That's awesome! If you DM your phone #or address, we can look up the tech and forward the feedback to them. Thanks! ^TF"
2017-04-20 13:00:47,You can also try searching in the guide - usually there is more information in the listings there. ^TF
2017-04-20 13:00:10,"I'm not seeing anything in the listings but it only goes up to the 28th right now, so you can check back in a day or two. ^TF"
2017-04-20 12:50:09,"Then once it's back online, check your WiFi network again. If it's still not working, please let us know. Thanks! ^TF"
2017-04-20 12:49:09,Thanks! Try doing a pin hole reset on the modem. Should be a reset button on back - hold that down for 10 seconds to reset. ^TF
2017-04-20 12:49:07,You're welcome! Let us know if we can help with anything else in the meantime. Have a great day! ^TF

2017-04-20 12:37:06,"We can take a look! Are you using your own router, or a Shaw WiFi modem? ^TF"
2017-04-20 12:24:07,"Hmmn, it should! Does it connect automatically at some hotspots but not others? Or just not at all? ^TF"
2017-04-20 11:28:11,"Promotions are temporary; can look into adj your services to cut costs down, DM us acct#anytime ^Ken"

2017-04-20 09:52:07,Glad to hear that it's back! Sounds like a temp glitch; think of it like a computer. May need a reset every now and then ^Ken

2017-04-20 09:29:07,"Hey Larry! Nothing reported so far, are other services (internet/phone) working ok? ^Ken"
2017-04-20 09:28:07,"Hmm, odd one to say the least. I recommend tweeting back, if you notice it live, so that we can take a closer look Chad! ^Ken"
2017-04-20 09:27:08,Sorry to hear that Kam! Do you remember which number dialed? There's a specific Moves team 1-877-512-2862 that can handle it ^KN
2017-04-20 09:09:07,"Hey Joel, 3rd one about it, if you can follow/DM acct#, can confirm for you ^Ken"

2017-04-20 09:00:22,"Hmm, if you had tried a bypass of router, comp direct to our modem and rebooted, any luck? ^Ken"
2017-04-20 08:53:06,"Hey Aidan, happening to wireless connections only, or also affecting wired? Using own wifi router or ours? ^Ken"
2017-04-20 08:13:07,"Def not good to have Netflix skip! Notice any other issues, or just happening while streaming? ^Ken"
2017-04-20 08:11:07,"Hey Emily! Most of the time, unplug/replug of the modem should help, try that yet? If so and still slow, plz let us know ^KN"
2017-04-20 08:08:07,"Sorry to hear Chad! What about other channels, or shows/series that you watch, freeze as well? ^Ken"

2017-04-19 22:19:07,"Could have been a small glitch on your end, I am happy to hear it is working now. ^JB"
2017-04-19 22:14:07,"No issues I see with CBC, what exactly do you see when you go to the channel now? ^JB"
2017-04-19 21:51:07,"Nothing I can see right now, what exactly is going on? ^JB"
2017-04-19 21:40:11,Sorry to hear that Try unscrewing the coax cable from the modem for 10 seconds then reconnecting it as well. ^JB
2017-04-19 20:51:07,Follow and DM us your account info and we can take a closer look ^JB
2017-04-19 20:44:11,"First thing to try would be to unplug the power to the digital box for one full minute, should fix in about 10 minutes ^JB"
2017-04-19 20:27:07,@tellsworth7 What are you seeing when you go to that channel now? ^JB
2017-04-19 19:09:07,All good!! My brain is being held up by copious amounts of coffee. :D ^DH
2017-04-19 19:01:07,"Sorry to hear of the delay. Please follow & DM us your address, glad to look into that for you. ^DH"
2017-04-19 18:59:23,Are you seeing that on WIFI or a wired connection? ^DH
2017-04-19 18:58:54,"Ok, can you unplug the cable box from power and plug it back in? Sometimes needs a reset to hold that setting we're finding. ^DH"
2017-04-19 18:51:07,"Hey there, please fill out this form; https:// community.shaw.ca/docs/DOC-5553 to request broadcast in HD. ^DH"
2017-04-19 18:42:41,That's great to hear. We will pass that on to his team. Thanks!!! ^DH
2017-04-19 18:42:23,That's great. Hope it stays stable for you! ^DH
2017-04-19 18:38:45,That's odd. Was the setting still set to Never after that happened? ^DH
2017-04-19 18:37:58,Ah that's good. Are you testing on WIFI or ethernet? Hopefully just a blip. ^DH
2017-04-19 18:37:22,"Ah, thank-you as well!!!!! Means a lot. Keep in touch. ^DH"
2017-04-19 18:28:40,Haha! Glad you got it sorted out! Keep in touch. :) ^DH
2017-04-19 18:26:28,Great thank-you. We will reply via DM. ^DH
2017-04-19 18:17:08,Try unplugging the cable box from power and plug it back in. Follow/DM us if it is still not showing them. ^DH
2017-04-19 18:14:11,Please follow and DM us your full address. We can look into that for you. ^DH
2017-04-19 18:05:20,NP! We do install cable outlets. You would want to take a look around the bottom of the walls to locate an outlet. ^DH
2017-04-19 17:59:51,We only install cable outlets and equipment. You'd want to contact an electrician for that kind of wiring. ^DH
2017-04-19 17:40:17,"Great, hope it will stick. Stay in touch. ^DH"
2017-04-19 17:35:35,"Thanks, definitely let me know how that goes. ^DH"
2017-04-19 17:34:08,"Awesome- that's great to hear, we will pass that on to his team ;) ^DH"
2017-04-19 17:30:28,Are all other channels working? Can you try unplugging the cable box and plugging it back in? ^DH
2017-04-19 17:27:37,Please follow & DM us your account #or address. ^DH
2017-04-19 17:23:31,Sorry to hear this. Is that happening on all channels or just the one? ^DH
2017-04-19 17:19:08,"No problem, just to be more clear I'm referring to the ethernet cable. ^DH"
2017-04-19 17:11:08,PC activity comes on when something plugged into ethernet port of modem. Do you have another ethernet cable you can check? ^DH
2017-04-19 16:45:03,Good afternoon! We're not seeing any issues at the moment. How many lights are solid on the modem ^DH
2017-04-19 15:36:08,"I can't speak for other providers, but our techs can only do outlet installs, and only on outside walls. ^TF"
2017-04-19 15:25:23,"Ok, no problem! We will let them take it from here. Have a great day! ^TF"
2017-04-19 15:24:07,Our tech can install outlets but will not be able to rewire your home. That's something that a contractor would need to do. ^TF
2017-04-19 15:09:07,Thanks! Can you send us a DM with the account info so we can take a closer look at the modem? ^TF
2017-04-19 15:05:10,We can take a look. Are you using your own router or a Shaw WiFi modem? Have you done any troubleshooting so far? ^TF
2017-04-19 14:40:12,We'll have to confirm some other info before it can be released. Can you please DM the account number? Thanks! ^TF
2017-04-19 14:34:12,"Even something like an aquarium could be causing the signal to be poor, so we'd want to check for that. ^TF"
2017-04-19 14:33:07,"Is the modem near anything that might be causing interference? Cordless phone, microwaves, baby monitors are common culprits. ^TF"
2017-04-19 14:12:07,Thanks! What package do you subscribe to? ^TF
2017-04-19 13:59:07,Thanks! Do you have issues when using your WiFi? Have you tried running a speed test? ^TF
2017-04-19 13:58:08,Sounds good! Hopefully it will air in Canada but not too sure yet. Fingers crossed for you! ^TF
2017-04-19 13:45:28,"We'll probably have more info closer to when it will be broadcast, which appears to be summer 2017 based on that link. ^TF"
2017-04-19 13:45:09,I don't see any info for it yet but my guess would be either HBO Canada (part of the Movie Network) or the NFL Network. ^TF
2017-04-19 13:37:09,"Excellent! If it goes down again, you can try those steps and let us know if you continue to have issues. Have a great day! ^TF"
2017-04-19 13:37:07,"Oh, perfect! Glad it's working again. Have a great day! ^TF"
2017-04-19 13:33:08,"Then plug power back in. If modem doesn't come back online in 5 minutes or so, please let us know. Hopefully that does the trick! ^TF"
2017-04-19 13:33:07,"Try unplugging power on modem, then disconnect coax cable from modem and splitter. Reconnect making sure connections are right."
2017-04-19 13:32:07,"Ah, ok! Splitters can fail over time so that could be the culprit, but sometimes reseating the coax helps, too. ^TF"
2017-04-19 13:30:31,"I'd suggest doing a factory reset on the modem by holding down reset button on back, then try changing channels again. ^TF"
2017-04-19 13:30:29,Sounds like WiFI interference. Could be a number of different causes. https:// community.shaw.ca/docs/DOC-2398 has some more info. ^TF
2017-04-19 13:29:07,I'm not seeing anything reported for that area so far. If you give business support a call they can take a look 1-877-742-9249 ^TF
2017-04-19 13:27:08,Thanks! Do you know if the modem is connected to the same outlet as tv with a splitter? ^TF
2017-04-19 13:23:07,Thanks for the report! Looks like that story is being linked from another site but I will let our online team know ASAP. ^TF
2017-04-19 13:21:07,"Thanks! Do you have any other services with us? If so, are they down as well? Or just internet affected? ^TF"
2017-04-19 13:07:08,Nothing reported so far. What sort of troubleshooting have you tried so far? We can take a look! ^TF
2017-04-19 13:04:07,We'd be happy to go over options! Info on our packages can be found on shaw.ca - let us know if you have any questions! ^TF
2017-04-19 13:03:07,Sorry about the wait! You can update it online if you prefer. Steps here: https:// community.shaw.ca/docs/DOC-1179#update … ^TF
2017-04-19 12:29:08,"If you close the browser, then open it back up again does it load properly? Sounds like it may be browser related. ^TF"
2017-04-19 12:28:11,No problem! No ETA yet but techs are working on it. Fingers crossed it's a quick fix. Have a great day! ^TF
2017-04-19 12:17:08,"Oh, just got word of an issue near Railway Ave. You can check http:// bit.ly/2osEqob for updates. Thanks! ^TF"
2017-04-19 12:13:08,"Seems to be working for me. Is this when you log in, or when you try to watch show or movie? ^TF"
2017-04-19 12:12:07,Nothing confirmed for that area so far. What services are you having trouble with? ^TF

2017-04-19 09:44:08,"Hey, our teams are still working to restore this. Apologies! ^HG"
2017-04-19 09:39:07,Hey! Sorry to hear. Is it choppy on all channels or a specific one? Other digital boxes also have the same issue? ^HG

2017-04-18 22:16:24,Most of the time when there's pixelization it means a poor signal to the cable box. I'd say in 90% of the times it gets reported to us 1/2

2017-04-14 17:57:08,That sounds like it would be a Shaw Cable account. :) ^LD
2017-04-14 17:53:07,Hey Amanda. It should be Shaw Cable or Shaw Direct depending on who they have an account with for service. ^LD
2017-04-14 17:28:06,Awesome! Let us know if there is anything further we can assist with. ^LD
2017-04-14 17:27:07,"It does look like the game is on so may be signal issue. Unscrew the cable ends off the box and cable outlet, then back on.^LD"
2017-04-14 17:24:08,"It's not uncommon for some variance, but should be more constant than that. Try a trace route http:// bit.ly/155WRFM ^LD"
2017-04-14 17:22:07,Hey Angie. The SN1 channel will have a black screen when there is currently no content airing. ^LD
2017-04-14 17:21:52,"You mentioned phone and TV as well, are they back up too? ^LD"
2017-04-14 17:19:40,Perfect! ^LD
2017-04-14 17:14:15,"Also just out of curiosity, what trouble were you having before unplugging the box? Any errors on screen? ^LD"
2017-04-14 17:13:08,Are you connecting directly to the Shaw modem or using a 3rd party router? ^LD
2017-04-14 17:13:07,There's more we can try to see about getting it up and running. What shows on the front of the digital box? ^LD
2017-04-14 17:12:06,"Try changing the wireless channel on the modem, see if you're able to get a better signal. http:// bit.ly/13VEoo1 ^LD"
2017-04-14 17:09:06,"Ahh ok, for the Shaw Community forums, you will need to create a new login. It won't be the same as your Shaw ID. ^LD"
2017-04-14 17:07:08,Is the cable from the cable outlet direct to the modem or is it split? Try unscrewing both ends and screw them back on. ^LD
2017-04-14 17:04:07,Hi Cezanne. You can find our current boxes here http:// bit.ly/1wuHCzy . Did you already troubleshoot your current box? ^LD
2017-04-14 16:59:06,Hi Karen. No issues at the moment. What sort of trouble are you having and is it with both wired and WIFI connections? ^LD
2017-04-14 16:58:07,Hey Jacob. Currently no issues in that area. What lights are showing on the Internet modem right now? ^LD

2017-04-14 16:52:06,Are you using the new Shaw ID from here http:// bit.ly/2nK0HgO or using the older log in? What error do you get? ^LD
2017-04-14 16:49:07,"You shouldn't have to, but it depends on when we get the information to update the guide, especially with the older guide. ^LD"
2017-04-14 16:36:06,"Hey Doug. I believe TSN5 April 16th, but best to do a search in the guide. ^LD"
2017-04-14 16:33:07,Hey Adam. TSN won't have anymore coverage NHL content. Playoff games will be on your local channels. ^LD
2017-04-14 16:32:07,It sounds like the guide may not be updated. You can try pulling power out for two minutes to let the box reset. ^LD
2017-04-14 16:17:07,That means it's the main Gateway that may have a signal issue. Try a reset on the Gateway http:// bit.ly/11SLbBj ^LD

2017-04-11 09:35:20,You might see better speeds on blue as it's connecting to more channels. Sorry for that first backwards reply. ^Lance
2017-04-11 09:28:02,"Yikes, I meant green is one channel, blue is connecting to multiple channels. So blue is better. That was a backwards answer. ^Lance"
2017-04-11 09:23:07,"Hi Scott. Blue's okay, means channel bonding is on one channel rather than checking more than one. Are speeds still same? ^LD"

2017-04-09 18:44:31,"There are several frequencies, and a few channels per frequency, so if only the one frequency is affected, only those channel would be. ^LD"
2017-04-09 18:42:49,Not really since it bases your location by IP for blackouts. ^LD
2017-04-09 18:41:38,"Well for instance, it could be the one cable outlet is having the issue, or even the cable from the cable outlet to the box. ^LD"
2017-04-09 18:39:26,"Not at all, we can arrange for a day you are available. ^LD"
2017-04-09 18:38:17,"Shouldn't, it would be determined by where your IP is registered. You can use a site like https://www. whatismyip.com / to see. ^LD"
2017-04-09 18:35:26,It is sounding however like we will need to have a tech out to investigate for you. If you could DM us we can get that set up for you. ^LD
2017-04-09 18:34:56,Sounds like it may be either a bad HDMI cable or the input on one end. Try plugging the HDMI into another input and switch to that input.^LD
2017-04-09 18:28:49,The bedroom being the standard definition box? When that occurs does it show a message or a black screen? Sounds like a signal issue. ^LD
2017-04-09 18:24:03,Ok pull power out of the digital box for two minutes and plug it back in. How often does this occur? ^LD
2017-04-09 18:17:56,"Try unplugging the HDMI cable from the back of the TV and digital box, then plug the ends back in. ^LD"
2017-04-09 18:10:25,Try turning the digital box off then back on. See if picture comes back on or if you get the same error. ^LD
2017-04-09 18:05:00,"Is it on all channels? What do you see on screen, a message or error? ^LD"
2017-04-09 17:57:39,"Hello Trini. Is that both wired and wireless connections? When you lose connection, do you notice the lights on the modem change? ^LD"
2017-04-09 17:53:35,"Hey Janine, are you having some trouble with your TV service? Let us know if you are, we are here to help! ^LD"
2017-04-09 17:47:12,We do have Voicemail options available with the Shaw Phone service for $6/month to add on. ^LD
2017-04-09 17:42:29,You're welcome. ^LD
2017-04-09 17:37:56,Or did you mean the terminal itself is broken and showing wires? ^LD
2017-04-09 17:37:00,"From the wall is fine, but you also need to remove the battery. That said, I would recommend bringing the power cable to retail to swap. ^LD"
2017-04-09 17:21:33,"Not to worry JP, you can find The Big Bang Theory on VOD here! http:// bit.ly/2og19XN ^LD"
2017-04-09 17:15:31,"You can find the steps here http:// bit.ly/29hCiht . If the Tel 1 light is coming on solid, you should be getting dial tone. ^LD"
2017-04-09 17:12:36,"Can do! What is the model of Shaw phone terminal you have, Arris or Motorola? ^LD"
2017-04-09 16:54:54,Let us know if it happens again. ^LD
2017-04-09 16:21:40,Hey Alex. When this happens do you notice if the lights on the modem change? Try changing the wireless channel http:// bit.ly/13VEoo1 ^LD
2017-04-09 16:11:55,You're welcome! ^LD
2017-04-09 16:06:29,"Hey Raven. Commercials we are not able remove, however if you record your programs on your PVR, you can skip past most of them. ^LD"
2017-04-09 16:01:43,"Try unscrewing the cable off the back of the box and off the cable outlet, then screw them back on and see if picture returns. ^LD"
2017-04-09 15:56:07,"Recent update changed the Power Saver to 3 hours (instead of never), http:// bit.ly/2piiVHg ; can change it back though! ^KN"
2017-04-09 15:44:07,"Hey Omid! No word about MAVTV, we welcome you to submit a channel request via http:// bit.ly/chanreq ^Ken"
2017-04-09 14:44:08,Are you able to sign into Shaw Webmail successfully? Try other web browsers just in case? ^Ken
2017-04-09 14:34:12,Is that through the TSN Go app? Can you try using your MyAccount login to see if that works. ^TD
2017-04-09 14:27:07,You are welcome. Let me know if you can run an independent speed test after he finishes the download. ^TD
2017-04-09 14:20:08,Speeds are limited to how fast the servers are for download. Signal looks perfect from what I can see here with no errors. ^TD
2017-04-09 14:09:07,Which game are you playing? It may be server related. Can you run a speed test at http:// speedtest.shaw.ca / ? ^TD
2017-04-09 14:02:07,Follow and DM us your Shaw account#so that we can take a closer look. ^Ken
2017-04-09 13:53:07,"Techs would have checked when present, if there were issues. SD chs, if you want full screen, would need to stretch. Otherwise, HD."
2017-04-09 13:42:08,"If techs have already visited to no avail, seems like these specific chs are SD only at this time. ^Ken"
2017-04-09 13:09:08,"Are HD channels full screen? If only SD, you can adjust it so that it stretches, check TV settings (aspect ratio/zoom) ^Ken"
2017-04-09 13:08:10,"Ken from @Shawhelp here, let us know if you have any questions about our services!"
2017-04-09 11:58:06,I can certainly send your feedback to the agents leadership team for coaching. DM me their name and information to me. ^TD
2017-04-09 11:52:07,I am sorry for the long wait times. You can certainly chat in to the BlueSky TV team here: https:// shaw.custhelp.com/app/chat/chat_ launch … ^TD
2017-04-09 11:28:07,Disconnect the coax from the modem and the wall outlet for one minute. Then plug it back in and power reset the modem. ^TD
2017-04-09 11:17:07,Your signal could use some work. Is the coax from the modem direct to a wall outlet or through a splitter? ^TD
2017-04-09 10:53:06,"Oh no! Sorry to hear of that. Let me know what you are interested in getting set up, I would love to help :) ^TD"
2017-04-09 10:10:20,Sorry to hear of that. Is it hanging and not working at certain times that require the restart? ^TD
2017-04-09 09:48:07,"Hey Dax, that was a recent update. Check out https:// community.shaw.ca/docs/DOC-11319 for more information :) ^TD"
2017-04-09 09:47:07,You are welcome. Have an amazing day!! ^TD
2017-04-09 09:34:07,Awesome! Glad to hear that was an easy fix. Let me know if anything changes. ^TD
2017-04-09 09:00:09,Signal looks good to the box. Can you give it a quick power reset by unplugging it for one minute. ^TD
2017-04-09 08:52:06,Do you have any other HDMI devices? Do you see the static when using them? (BlueRay or game consoles) ^TD
2017-04-09 08:47:07,"Might be a faulty HDMI cord, do you have another handy to swap it with? ^TD"
2017-04-09 08:45:07,Swap the ends and let me know if you still see the bit of static. ^TD
2017-04-09 08:34:06,"Unplug the coax from the back of the TV Box and the outlet for one minute, then plug it back in and power reset the box ^TD"
2017-04-09 08:32:06,"When you unplug the HDMI cord, do you still see the white flash at the bottom of the screen? ^TD"
2017-04-09 08:29:06,Do you see that on multiple channels? Can you swap ends of the HDMI cord from your TV to the TV Box. ^TD
2017-04-09 08:21:06,BlueSky TV is available in your area. Please check out https://www. shaw.ca/television/blu eskytv … for more information. ^TD
2017-04-09 08:20:09,It may be signal related. Is the coax from the box going direct to a wall outlet or through a splitter? ^TD
2017-04-09 08:19:06,"If you have a foam roller, I find that is the best remedy to use in the morning :) ^TD"
2017-04-09 08:06:06,I am sorry to hear of that experience. I have more information here: https:// community.shaw.ca/docs/DOC-2159 . ^TD
2017-04-09 08:04:07,That is odd. Has this happened before? It may be power related if it is plugged into a power bar. ^TD

2017-04-04 09:58:53,2/2 wait 2 minutes again and then router to power. this establishes the marriage between the two devices again. The order is a bit important
2017-04-04 09:58:15,business account access is limited but if there is a modem + a wifi router. Have both off of power for 2 minutes. plug mdm to power 1/2

2017-03-16 21:20:22,You could run an ethernet cable from modem/router unit -> XBox directly to get a direct connection though! ^BE
2017-03-16 21:19:58,For a second modem you'd need to get a completely separate Internet connection through us. ^BE
2017-03-16 21:12:55,I see. Have you tried doing a pinhole reset on the modem yet? That can also help correct speed issues^EL
2017-03-16 21:12:25,Could also be that servers for Xbox are busier than usual tonight- that's also another possibility^EL
2017-03-16 21:11:07,"Ah ok, should be all good with d/ling then if you're getting 100+ down. What are you downloading on Xbox right now?^EL"

2017-03-16 17:17:30,Definitely strange. Are the TV/Phone/Internet all connected to different cable outlets in the home? Or split off same one? ^BE
2017-03-16 17:08:00,"Oh no! Sorry to hear that. How long have they been off? And are all the devices (modem etc) on the same coax outlet, or no? ^BE"

2017-03-05 19:43:44,unplugging the coax can help to actually improve the signal strength^EL
2017-03-05 19:42:31,"Yep it can make a huge difference, as the signal itself comes from the coax. Unplugging power alone resets the modem, but..."
2017-03-05 19:38:41,"Thx for confirming. When unplugging, did you undo the coax cable from the wall outlet+modem? Or just the power cable?^EL"
2017-03-05 19:31:54,"Ok, and just to confirm, are you using a third party router, or just the Shaw one?^EL"

2017-03-05 17:46:54,I see. TV's can actually cause wifi interference- would be worth a shot to move the modem further away & see if that helps?^EL

2017-03-01 22:16:54,Also relocating your modem to the most central area of your home and up off the floor should certainly help. ^BE
2017-03-01 22:16:29,I'd recommend always using the 5Ghz network if it's available (5G at end of name) ^BE
2017-03-01 22:16:12,If you have any cordless phones/baby monitors etc in the house they may be interfering ^BE

2017-01-27 15:29:07,We're not seeing any area issues at this time. Is it all channels or one specific? ^DH

2017-01-27 14:27:06,"For sure, it's a common inquiry and may happen yet. We just haven't heard of plans or details at this time. ^DH"
2017-01-27 14:22:07,We haven't heard of anything. Freerange TV is really meant for portable devices only at this time. ^DH
2017-01-27 14:18:07,"Those types of changes are not in the guide (live decisions), it would just record the interruption and time slot picked. ^DH"
2017-01-27 14:14:07,That's great to hear about SOD. Sounds like we may have had an area signal issue then possibly. ^DH
2017-01-27 14:08:07,re-attach the power. It's possible there may be a slight signal issue. This will clean the connectors and hopefully help.2/2 ^DH

2017-01-26 20:42:59,Awesome! Always a good idea to unplug both the Shaw modem+router when experiencing internet issues! Have a great evening ^EL
2017-01-26 20:32:40,"Okay, another good way to potentially release the IP is to unhook the modem completely overnight. It'll be worth a shot!^EL"
2017-01-26 20:28:40,"hook the router back up to it, once the Shaw modem is online. That should get the connection going again2/2 ^EL"

2017-01-26 17:07:08,"Thanks! Splitters can fail over time, so it might need to be replaced. But sometimes reseating the cables will fix it, too."

2017-01-26 17:00:09,Thanks! Have you done any troubleshooting? Sounds like it could be signal related. Are you using a splitter? ^TF

2017-01-25 20:52:08,What did you do when you tried to release/renew the IP?
2017-01-25 20:52:07,Hmmn. Sometimes blocks get reassigned and it takes a bit of time to update so that might be it.

2017-01-19 22:04:05,"Hm ok, first step would be to unplug the power+coax cables from the box+wall outlet for 20secs. See if that helps!^EL"
2017-01-19 21:37:09,"Sounds good, keep us posted!^EL"
2017-01-19 21:30:25,"Hm, could you try a live recording right now on any random channel for say 15-20 mins & see if it does the same thing?^EL"
2017-01-19 21:25:19,I see. Are you getting a specific error code? We could look it up to pinpoint the cause of the issue^EL

2017-01-19 20:26:44,That will often correct any issues with freezing 2/2 ^EL
2017-01-19 20:26:30,I see. A good starting point would be for her to unplug the power+coax cables from the box+wall outlet for 20secs 1/2 ^EL
2017-01-19 20:25:48,I see. Could be interference in the home. Can you check around for items listed in this article? http:// bit.ly/1JfoLxW ^EL

2017-01-19 10:06:38,Your modem's currently bridged. Is this while through wifi only? ^Ken
2017-01-19 08:53:07,"To factory reset, simply hold down pinhole-reset button at back of modem for at least 30s before letting go! ^Ken"

2017-01-19 08:44:06,"Odd issue to hear. If it does happen again, try a factory reset to modem (if you have custom settings, save it prior to reset)^KN"
2017-01-19 08:34:07,"Happen all the time, or when you're uploading/streaming in the background? On all devices or a particular one? ^Ken"

2017-01-18 22:13:07,Thx for trying! How about a pinhole reset? Press down on the pinhole button for 20 seconds & see if it's any better ^EL
2017-01-18 21:58:07,"Hey, 1st thing to try would be: unplug power+coax cables for 20 secs from wall+modem. Is this wifi, or wired in directly?^EL"
2017-01-18 21:32:06,Great! Keep us posted on how it goes. There are a few other things we can try if that doesn't end up helping ^EL
2017-01-18 21:22:07,Wired usually gets you higher speeds (no wifi interference) but if you unplug the pwr+coax cables for 20secs it should help^EL

2017-01-18 20:30:08,Have you tried using the wifi on the Shaw modem by itself to compare speed results? Can also pin-hole reset the router^EL
2017-01-18 20:27:07,"Hey Joann, blue screen usually means the TV's on the wrong input. Have you tried flipping channels/TV inputs yet?^EL"

2017-01-18 20:11:06,"Hi Josh, when resetting, did you unplug both the power & coax cables from the wall outlet +modem for 20 secs?^EL"
2017-01-18 19:48:07,"Phew, yeah! Definitely helps that cable is still working. Hopefully it will be a quick fix for Internet. Enjoy the game! ^TF"

2017-01-18 19:44:07,But I do see that an appointment has been booked for tomorrow so tech will be able to take care of it for you then. ^TF
2017-01-18 19:43:08,Unfortunately most of our techs are likely done for the day so getting someone out tonight may be difficult.
2017-01-18 19:42:07,Thanks! Looks like a known issue. No ETA yet but techs are aware. Updates will be posted here http:// bit.ly/2iDxc2k

2017-01-18 19:08:07,We have had some other reports of this issue. Unplugging the power on the cable box for 30 seconds should get it going again. ^TF
2017-01-18 18:55:09,Thanks! Let us know if you have any other questions. Have a good night! ^TF
2017-01-18 18:53:07,"Yup, should be. Typos happen to the best of us, I guess. :) We won't be able to it fix now, but thanks for letting us know! ^TF"
2017-01-18 18:47:07,But you can try emailing our App Support team at appsupport@sjrb.ca so they can take a look. Thanks! ^TF
2017-01-18 18:47:06,Thanks! Unfortunately I don't think there is anything that can be done as it's there as an authentication step.

2017-01-18 18:36:07,It sounds like it's doing that just to confirm that your account has the appropriate subscription to allow access.
2017-01-18 18:31:07,"According to http://www. sportsnet.ca/schedule/ it's on SNW, and SNO - blackout restrictions may apply."
2017-01-18 18:29:07,According to http://www. sportsnet.ca/schedule/ it should be on Sportsnet or SN360 depending on your region. ^TF
2017-01-18 18:19:07,"Not sure - they created the app, so we're limited in what we can support. Does your log in information work every time? ^TF"

2017-01-10 22:41:08,"Hi Dakota, you can find that here http:// bit.ly/2jhgLFH . Basically means your PVR is almost full and may not record.^LD"
2017-01-10 22:30:33,"Aww thanks guys, we try our best! ^LD"
2017-01-10 22:24:54,"lol, Sorry my bad, I read that as 91% full! Please do let us know if it fails again. ^LD"
2017-01-10 22:21:06,"Hmm, when the PVR is pretty full, what can happen is it may not record if other higher priority items are set to record. ^LD"
2017-01-10 22:17:06,"Hey Grainne. It may be intermittent for a bit, there is a know issue in that area. ^LD"
2017-01-10 22:12:07,"If it occurs again, have him contact us so we can take a look at the modem for him. ^LD"
2017-01-10 22:10:09,Hey Chelsea. These were both manual recordings or was the first a series recording? How much space is left on the PVR? ^LD
2017-01-10 22:07:18,Sounds good. Let us know if that helps! ^LD
2017-01-10 21:42:24,"What connects to the other side of the split? If just TV, try unscrewing all the cable ends, and screw them back on. ^LD"
2017-01-10 21:32:06,Wow that's not good! Is the cable from the modem to the cable outlet direct or split? ^LD
2017-01-10 21:22:07,"If you follow and DM us, we can take a look and see if the modem is online. If so, it may just need to be rebooted. ^LD"
2017-01-10 21:20:44,"Hey Allye. That's odd, I don't remember a purple light, just green or blue I believe. ^LD"
2017-01-10 21:19:57,Is the cable from the modem direct to the cable outlet or is it split? ^LD
2017-01-10 21:19:06,Can you run a trace route and send it to us so we can have a look? ^LD
2017-01-10 21:12:36,Hey Jordan. I don't see any issues out that way. What lights are showing on the modem? ^LD
2017-01-10 21:12:07,"Hey Luke, I don't see any area issues out that way. What lights do you see on the Shaw modem? ^LD"
2017-01-10 21:10:10,Does it seem to occur around the same time of day or pretty random? ^LD
2017-01-10 21:08:06,"Hey Grainne. Usually if power related, our equipment takes a little longer to get back online. What lights are on the modem? ^LD"
2017-01-10 21:02:07,Hey Mat. Is that with a wired or wireless connection? Do you use a 3rd party router or just the Shaw modem? ^LD
2017-01-10 20:59:07,"Hey Scott. No I don't believe so. Some commentss are listed as in Toronto, where we don't have service. ;) ^LD"
2017-01-10 20:59:06,"Hey Brent. Doesn't look like we have service in that area, however you can check with @ShawDirect . ^LD"
2017-01-10 20:49:09,Oh nice! :D ^LD
2017-01-10 20:49:07,Hey PAMELLA. Is this in the guide or with VOD? ^LD
2017-01-10 20:48:07,"Try changing the wireless channel on the modem, see if that improves your connection. http:// bit.ly/13VEoo1 ^LD"
2017-01-10 20:37:07,"Try it on the one first, see if it makes any difference. ^LD"
2017-01-10 20:28:06,"Ok, also try unscrewing the cable off the back of the box and off the outlet, then screw back on. See if it clears up. ^LD"
2017-01-10 20:21:06,That does seem kind of odd. We'll look into it. ^LD
2017-01-10 20:12:08,"For that one, try unplugging both ends of the HDMI and plug them back in, see if it continues. Any video distortions? ^LD"
2017-01-10 20:03:11,That is odd that it's different channels on the different boxes. Are these connected with HDMI? ^LD
2017-01-10 19:48:07,Haven't heard of any known issues for tonight. Is this happening on all your TVs?^EL

2017-01-10 18:51:21,"It's the other cable attached to the Shaw modem, that's not the power cable http:// bit.ly/2j3rMNr ^EL"
2017-01-10 18:50:31,Would you be able to get to the wall outlet & unplug the coax from there Alyssa? It'll likely resolve the signal issue^EL
2017-01-10 18:44:22,"Hey Alyssa, when unplugging, did you also unplug the coax cable from the modem + wall outlet for 20 secs? ^EL"
2017-01-10 18:30:09,If that's the case changing channels would be the best bet. If you ever get newer devices they should have no problem on 5g^EL
2017-01-10 18:25:09,Can you try unplugging the pwr+coax cables for 20secs from modem+wall outlet? Modem's online so should be fine after that^EL
2017-01-10 18:08:07,5G will have less interference than 2.4. Best to connect to 5G whenever you can. Is your device unable to connect to that?^EL

2016-12-30 19:30:09,Hey Chelsea. Both cable and Internet? No issues in the area at the moment. Do both share the same cable outlet? ^LD

2016-12-30 18:59:06,Sorry to hear that thatskabachia. Here are some steps you can try to get dial tone back http:// bit.ly/1fzvke1 ^LD
2016-12-30 18:03:06,I would recommend taking a look at our current cable packages. They may meet your needs and possibly even reduce cost. ^LD
2016-12-30 17:54:08,"However I do not currently know what cable package you are subscribed to, so that is just an example of a package without.^LD"
2016-12-30 17:54:07,"Well, if you are subscribed to Basic Cable which doesn't include the HD version, you can add on HD Sports pack $8/month. ^LD"

2016-12-30 15:20:09,"Shouldn't be seeing lag like that with those speeds, are you direct to the modem seeing the lag spikes or wifi? ^JB"
2016-12-30 15:18:07,Not every device can be controlled by our remote and that may be the case here. ^JB
2016-12-30 15:08:06,Best option will be to use this it has the most access to codes to attempt to get it working ^JB http:// bit.ly/2aHFJsO

2016-12-29 22:24:29,That was a continuation of the previous tweet when I asked you if you could move the modem upstairs^El
2016-12-29 22:22:09,can also look into sending a tech out to help with moving the modem upstairs if you'd like ^EL
2016-12-29 22:21:47,Darn. Moving it upstairs would be best. Otherwise you can try to minimize wifi interference http:// bit.ly/1JfoLxW We...
2016-12-29 22:13:39,Just want to see how the signal strength is when it's not having to go thru the floor of the main level from the bsmnt^EL

2016-12-29 21:47:10,Hey! Is it possible to move the modem to the main floor? The most ideal placement for the modem would be there^EL
2016-12-29 21:33:20,Possible that your IP isn't registering for YEG. It's worth a shot to contact your cell provider if you must use data & not wifi
2016-12-29 21:23:02,"Sometimes when on cell ph data, it can show you as being somewhere else. If you connect on wifi, the error msg should go away^EL"

2016-12-22 20:17:29,Would be best to unplug all as we don't know for sure which (if any) are the source of the signal issue ^EL
2016-12-22 20:08:47,"If you see something like this http:// bit.ly/2fhMo0k hooked up, can you plz unplug all cables going into it for 20secs?^EL"
2016-12-22 19:59:19,"When doing the reset, did you also unplug the coax cable from the wall +modem, or just the pwr? If you haven't already can you try?"

2016-12-22 18:20:15,Might be a signal issue then. Does the coax cable go straight from back of box to wall outlet? Or split first? ^BE
2016-12-22 18:16:41,"Can you please try pulling the pwr cable for 30s, plugging it back in, and giving it ~15-20 mins to load back up? Thx! ^BE"
2016-12-22 18:13:17,If that's happening over WiFi it's likely WiFi interference. Plz try these steps http:// bit.ly/WiFiTS ^BE

2016-12-18 15:15:23,"Sorry to hear that the internet is giving you trouble today. I can take a look at my end, is it wifi only? ^SJ"
2016-12-18 13:43:07,Can u pls unplug frm power. Reconnect the coax cable at back of box+at the wall outlet. If there is a splitter do both ends?
2016-12-18 13:38:07,That pixelation is pretty high. Are there any other channels affected? Is the cable split from the wall to anything else?
2016-12-18 13:32:07,Sorry to hear about the troubles with the feed. Is it pixelation you are having difficulty with? ^Sj
2016-12-18 13:24:06,I don't see any incidents in that area going on right now but we can investigate into this further. Can u DM w/acc#?
2016-12-18 13:22:07,"Thanks, I don't see any incidents in CGY going on right now but we can investigate into this further. Can u DM w/acc#?"
2016-12-18 13:12:10,Are there any devices connected to the modem by an ethernet or are all devices wifi?
2016-12-18 12:49:06,Def not downloading the guide data. Try the reboot and coax cable step in one shot. The guide info should start dl again shortly
2016-12-18 12:43:40,You can also try to disconnect+reconnect the coax cable at back of box and wall outlet.
2016-12-18 12:43:10,It looks like the guide information isn't downloading. Generally this can be fixed by power cycling the box (rebooting) 1/2
2016-12-18 12:19:06,"Could you cycle your digital box? Remove power & coax (at the wall as well) for 2 min. Then reconnecting everything, power last."
2016-12-18 12:12:07,Sorry to hear that. Don't see any issues on our end for those ch #. Is this across all boxes you have or just one? ^Harvey
2016-12-18 12:08:07,You would need a coax cable outlet in the deck.. a power outlet alone would not work. ^Harvey
2016-12-18 11:59:06,The gateways are not entirely wireless. They communicate to each other w/o but still require connection w/outlet and TV
2016-12-18 11:58:07,"Odd, I seem to be having trouble with my login too. I will let our teams know about this."
2016-12-18 11:48:07,I just checked one of the TV's that has the Gateway set up and it shows guide information. Does this happen on all TV's?
2016-12-18 10:27:06,I'm not entirely sure when it would be rolled out :)
2016-12-18 10:10:09,Oh! Thanks for the clarification :)
2016-12-18 10:00:13,"When you get home, I suggest powering modem off for 2 min. Reconnect all the coax cables and try again."
2016-12-18 10:00:09,"Oh no, please double check the ethernet cable and or try another ethernet port on the modem."
2016-12-18 09:58:21,"I see that now, thanks. The signals are slightly off but other than that. It should be working, was this over WiFi?"
2016-12-18 09:54:07,Your modem is showing me that it's online and IP address is available. Signals are also great too. Is this just WiFi?
2016-12-18 09:50:19,Can you shoot over a DM to us so we can take a look? Pls include the acc #
2016-12-18 09:49:06,I don't see any alerts up for that area but we can investigate in case of an emerging one. What services are u having trouble w/?

2016-12-17 19:02:06,Thanks! Could just be wireless interference. Have you tried changing your wifi channel? Sometimes you have to test a few out. ^TF
2016-12-17 18:54:07,"Hmmn, is this only affecting WiFi? Or does a wired connection cut out as well? ^TF"

2016-12-10 22:56:06,"Hello, just FYI, we don't have control over channel rebrands. That is up to the network, not the cable provider."
2016-12-10 22:53:06,"We don't throttle service, so you may want to do some troubleshooting. This should help: https:// community.shaw.ca/docs/DOC-8170"
2016-12-10 22:50:08,"May need to test out a few to see which works best. If that doesn't fix it, please let us know! ^TF"
2016-12-10 22:49:06,"I would recommend changing the wireless channel, as it could just be interference. Steps here: https:// community.shaw.ca/docs/DOC-1046"
2016-12-10 22:45:09,"Thanks! Can you try unplugging the modem for 30 seconds to reset it, then test again? Let us know if that doesn't work."
2016-12-10 22:42:06,Is that the package you have now? Are you using WiFi only or a direct wired connection? ^TF
2016-12-10 22:30:24,"How did you reach this conclusion? What pkg are you specifically on? Wireless only, or also affecting wired connections? ^Ken"
2016-12-10 22:30:09,"Sorry to see that Nikki! Is this while on wifi only, or also on a wired connection? ^Ken"
2016-12-10 22:28:07,"Hmm, what modem do you currently have right now? Do you also have a separate router connected? ^Ken"
2016-12-10 22:13:07,"Nothing reported at this time; is our modem online, with 4 solid lights, or any of them blinking? ^Ken"
2016-12-10 22:12:07,"If you can DM us your account number, we can get it switched for you. Thx! ^Ken"
2016-12-10 21:42:06,Perfect! Glad to hear that worked. Let us know if we can help with anything else. Have a good night! ^TF
2016-12-10 21:38:07,"Then plug it back in, and give it 5 minutes or so to get back online. Let us know if that doesn't fix it. Thanks! ^TF"
2016-12-10 21:37:07,Thanks! The modem most likely just needs to be reset. Can you try unplugging the power for 30 seconds?
2016-12-10 21:37:07,"Looks like we received your DM, so we will get back to you there. Thanks! ^TF"

2016-12-10 21:00:10,"If you want to use your own router, then it's best to put the Shaw modem in bridge mode. I can do that now if you would like? ^TF"
2016-12-10 21:00:10,Thanks! It doesn't look like the connection has been dropping on our end. Sounds like a network conflict as there are 2 routers.

2016-12-05 09:33:07,"Nothing in NW, UBC currently having some troubles. Is WiFi and direct to modem affected?"
2016-12-05 09:32:07,"Not hearing of any issues in EDM, is this over wifi or direct to modem?"
2016-12-05 09:26:31,"wifi range extender will still be less than a ""so-so"" router, even for one of the best extenders. Check that cpu site :)"
2016-12-05 09:25:51,"cuz.. if you're going to spend money buying a new ""so-so"" router. might as well spend $$$ and buy a really good one."
2016-12-05 09:19:06,Which area in vancouver?
2016-12-05 09:18:07,an extender would pick up the existing signal and then increase the range for better coverage in the home.
2016-12-05 09:17:21,It is possible w/a 3rd party router and fiddling w/alot of settings and running wire. TBH option #2 would be easier/cheaper
2016-12-05 09:12:01,get a powerful wifi router or buy a wifi range extender (cheaper option). http://www. memoryexpress.com /
2016-12-05 09:11:06,probly got 2 options if theres not enuff wifi coverage in the house. since it's not giving equal coverage to everywhere else
2016-12-05 09:09:06,"Sorry to hear that, is this over wifi or direct to the modem by an ethernet ?"
2016-12-05 09:08:06,Mon-Sat: 8:00am-5:00pm :)
2016-12-05 09:07:06,What an Internet hog!! I'm going to assume that it won't be moving to a different spot..which would be ideal solution
2016-12-05 08:59:06,Is the modem centrally located in the house?
2016-12-05 08:58:07,Wifi or direct to the modem?
