2017-11-26 16:49:19,That’s a shame. Hopefully you would have something in the future as I find the hotspots very unreliable for social platforms like Facebook and Snapchat. I find data works much faster. I will check this see if @TELUSsupport has anything.
2017-11-26 16:39:35,@Shawhelp I will be in Kelowna at relative’s condo for 5 day vacation. Not worth activating Shaw for short time. Any options for short term internet use?
2017-11-26 16:28:33,@Shawhelp Do your company offer TV services in Quebec?
2017-11-26 16:27:42,@Shawhelp the reps on the phone and on chat are giving abysmal service today.. so rude!! Time to have a chat with them. Thinking it’s time to go to #Telus
2017-11-26 16:26:32,Shawopen is worse.

2017-11-26 16:16:22,I've already tried that. I've also deleted the profile off my phone and reinstalled. The other devices has problems too.
2017-11-26 16:12:31,@Shawhelp would have been fun watching the grey cup but you guys messed up installation and still have yet to fix it #argos #stamps
2017-11-26 16:12:03,It gets to the point that of turning WiFi off now. It was one of the reasons we've stayed with Shaw services for so long.
2017-11-26 16:12:00,@Shawhelp How much to hook up the TSN channel to watch the Grey Cup for the night?
2017-11-26 16:11:16,It's been happening more so in the past couple of weeks.
2017-11-26 16:07:12,@Shawhelp what's up with shawpasspoint? It says connected but my apps says I'm not connected to the Internet?
2017-11-26 15:39:04,Reply? It’s been only 3 hours... 6 months is ways to go. Hold tight!

2017-11-24 17:53:19,"I still struggle to see how a router that works nearly perfectly most of the time could be the problem if the issue only occurs at a specific time of day. I believe it is because shaw uses cable not a DSL connection, thus I must share bandwidth with other customer."

2017-11-24 17:14:31,"no wired.... I've been through this several times, you look then say everything seems normal, then when I continue to complain you say you'll send a tech who also says everything is normal... normal shouldn't be spikes of nearly 2k ping to a games server."

2017-11-24 16:56:47,@Shawhelp maybe it's time to switch your infrastructure to something a little more modern.... Really getting sick of the massive drops in speed and reliability around 4:30 - 5:30pm every day....

2017-11-23 08:19:02,"@Rogers @TELUS @Shawhelp @Bell what is you position on the #netneutrality repeal? Will you try and manipulate our ISP speeds and information for your benefit? I have seen that Telus tried it previously, just want to know if the rest of the big players will have integrity."

2017-11-23 07:12:48,@Shawhelp any known issues with internet in Saskatoon? Wifi signal broadcasting but pages not connecting on all devices.
2017-11-23 07:05:49,"At Shaw Direct, we do not have any cancellation fees. Are you sure your account is for satellite TV? *dm"
2017-11-23 06:51:22,It doesn't directly but it could eventually. You really think companies like @Bell @TELUS or @Shawhelp will sit idle if the US gets rid of Net Neutrality? Not to mention a lot of US websites and content providers could be effected.
2017-11-23 06:22:07,"@Shawhelp just got Bluesky & 150 last Friday. Getting very inconsistent results. Using 5G network. Only gets 100+ within 10' of router. It should be better than this, right? pic.twitter.com/v6sLdwj7RD"

2017-11-22 21:59:26,Hi @ShawDirect @Shawhelp . Would love to know why you want to charge me 400 to cancel my subscription when I told you I need to move home to a rural town where your services aren’t offered to take care of my mother dying of cancer???What kind of uncompassionate company are you??
2017-11-22 21:28:09,No but I did call in and they said there are a few issues in my area too. They are working on it. I just wanted to see. Thank-you for getting back to me.
2017-11-22 20:32:12,Why dont y'all have the channels that are broadcasting it? As apposed to have 5 channels showing the same game
2017-11-22 20:28:18,So where can I watch the OKC/ Golden State game then?
2017-11-22 20:22:30,Good evening @Shawhelp . Are there any issues in south east Edmonton currently? Internet and Bluesky coming in and out. Thank-you
2017-11-22 20:15:07,@Shawhelp @shawcable how do y'all have 5 of the same hockey game playing on 5 different channels but not one with OKC/GSW NBA game on?!
2017-11-22 19:49:52,"@Shawhelp oh, newest response from you guys is 11 hours ago! What the hell? Where is the Canucks game?!"
2017-11-22 19:48:33,"@Shawhelp the Canucks game, where is it???????"
2017-11-22 19:38:18,@Shawhelp is cable service in Cougar Ridge disrupted? Ours is down
2017-11-22 19:35:00,Ok. Thanks or the response. Why @Sportsnet ?
2017-11-22 19:23:04,"Ok @Shawhelp explain this. I'm in Sudbury and I can watch SNPacific, SN360, SN1, SNEast, SNOntario but can't watch Oilers on SNWest on Freerange? My friend can watch anything he wants anywhere on Telus. What gives?"
2017-11-22 18:48:46,@Shawhelp Is there an outage in northeast Edmonton or is it just my cable line (again)?
2017-11-22 18:40:51,Hi there! We'd be happy to help you with that! :) Please send us a DM with the details or chat with us at http:// bit.ly/sd-chat . *fpl

2017-11-22 18:18:17,@Shawhelp how can I get a new remote for my satellite box? Not even new batteries made a difference to how terrible mine works
2017-11-22 18:12:09,thanks that worked
2017-11-22 18:09:12,Oh wow thx..didn't realize these channels were added to the HD lineup!
2017-11-22 18:02:34,@Shawhelp getting cannot communicate with shaw gateway. have checked cable connection. what is next?
2017-11-22 17:30:58,@Shawhelp hey..why is Toronto-Florida and Ottawa-Washington not on NHL Centre Ice?..they are only on the SD Sportsnet East and Ontario..which are not in HD
2017-11-22 17:27:40,@Shawhelp what external hard drive do you recommend for a digital box?
2017-11-22 17:17:27,@Shawhelp Why do I have to suffer through a shitty Oilers game on SNW just because I don’t have SN360 to watch the Flames? What gives?
2017-11-22 17:15:39,Why can't I watch this game? I'm a center ice subscriber @Shawhelp https:// twitter.com/MapleLeafs/sta tus/933488964224331777 …
2017-11-22 16:57:07,"@Shawhelp I live in Alberta, where is my @Canucks game?? I have NHL Centre Ice."
2017-11-22 16:42:33,*Cough Cough* @Shawhelp
2017-11-22 16:36:09,. 100% kids movies and TV shows as far as I can see it. Quite disappointing. I get that not all programs would be available but the commercials oversell what is available for sure. Gotta love the Netflix downloads and streaming for one low price.
2017-11-22 15:33:14,"I'd love to be able to control my DVR from my phone like I could with gateway. I switched to BlueSky, but I sure miss that app"
2017-11-22 15:27:25,@Shawhelp any plans for a BlueSky app???
2017-11-22 14:15:34,I've unplugged and restarted it at least 20 times in the last month! It's been spotty for this long but according to Shaw there's nothing wrong. I've talked to other friends who have Shaw and it's the same issue. Takes 10 minutes to load one page
2017-11-22 14:10:35,What is going on with the internet in Victoria BC?? It's been slow for weeks and now it's actually kicking me off!! Are you guys gonna fix this or should I take my business to @TELUS or @jucestatus ?? Because if I hear one more time that there's nothing wrong...
2017-11-22 13:12:41,The Shaw help team Danielle are among the Best (truly the truth)
2017-11-22 13:09:24,Do we know a date and channel yet for the Christmas music @Shawhelp ? I know on @SIRUSAUTOMOTIVE its started steaming already!
2017-11-22 12:42:54,"Can I just say that the live help @Shawhelp are amazing. My father, who admits to not being technologically savvy, was able to live chat and hook the new modem up while I was out. #thankyou"
2017-11-22 12:19:57,Just sent a DM with my account number.
2017-11-22 12:18:24,"@Shawhelp Myinternet has been cutting in & out for the last hour & now seems to be completely gone. I’m in Langley, BC"

2017-11-22 10:59:53,"Mine went down at exactly 6:26am, 3.5 hours now."
2017-11-22 10:35:53,"Ah, great, I wasn’t sure if they were supposed to spend those two hours here or if they may arrive at any time between 9 and 11. Cheers."
2017-11-22 10:26:39,One hour later and services are still down. Don't you think an update or ETA would help us better plan the day? Or perhaps we should contact @TELUS or @Shawhelp for a solution?
2017-11-22 10:25:33,@Shawhelp any reason your internet is down ?
2017-11-22 09:21:57,"Our Shaw gateway portal is always telling us that the portal needs to be connected, well it is......frustrating"
2017-11-22 07:58:57,"@Shawhelp Been trying to use your Freebird app for downloads but the only TV shows are kids and the ONLY movie is ""Harriet the Spy"" (using filter ""available for download""). Am I missing something? Your TV commercials suggest a much wider variety of items available for download."
2017-11-22 02:31:02,"@Shawhelp I keep getting a message when I try to open some websites saying my connection was interrupted, even though I can load other sites completely normally. No idea what's causing it."

2017-11-21 22:40:49,Wonder what @Shawhelp is offering people currently to switch from TELUS
2017-11-21 22:30:05,Grass is greener on the other side @Shawhelp
2017-11-21 22:09:37,I will thank you
2017-11-21 22:00:47,@TELUSsupport on hold for over an hour! In which reality do you guys live in that you think that any of us have time to sit and wait this long? If you don't take care of your customers @Shawhelp will!

2017-11-17 14:53:47,"Yep! Had great customer service yesterday with @Shawhelp . 30 seconds on hold, restored my precious service all@while saving $50/month. Great company!"
2017-11-17 14:52:16,"@Shawhelp @ShawInfo Just had a really great customer experience with Stacey on Shaw Chat. So helpful and accommodating. The survey didn't pop up at the end of our session so I couldn't leave feedback but I want to make sure you all know I was super satisfied. Thanks, Stacey!"
2017-11-17 12:03:50,Sorry guys... cant stream atm @Shawhelp is acting up and im not getting my full upload speed... ill keep you posted..
2017-11-17 09:57:11,Would you be able to assess our current plan and equipment and give me best options?
2017-11-17 09:50:10,"I see there’s a modem for $50 on the website- would that one be better than what I’ve got? (Better range, faster?)"
2017-11-17 09:48:08,Ok I’ll try that when I get home from work in a couple hours.... we’ve tried unplugging etc but not restarting the computer.
2017-11-17 09:44:49,No everything looks the same we just suddenly don’t have wifi
2017-11-17 09:42:27,It connects to our wifi but only for a few minutes then drops it. I can see the neighbours wifi but ours disappears. Would a new modem solve this?
2017-11-17 09:39:55,Hi there! Found the issue! It's our router. Thanks for the help though! Really appreciate it.
2017-11-17 09:32:53,It came from Shaw... pic.twitter.com/dSBo69L83Q
2017-11-17 09:29:33,Our modem is way older than those listed and doesn’t appear to be able to change channels. And it’s worked fine for 8 years but recently has been doing this. I’m confused!
2017-11-17 09:24:51,@Shawhelp our wifi keeps dropping. Any idea what can cause that?
2017-11-17 09:13:04,"Hi! Thanks for the reply! I power cycled our modem and our router, and it still seems to be down. Our modem says that we're connected to Wi-Fi, but there's no stable connection."
2017-11-17 09:05:55,Bell MTS did an update got rid for no reason how the guide is presented. Just seeing if your channel guides are what I like

2017-11-16 09:52:07,Had a Cisco originally changed it to hitron. Then in his was out door says something like I’ll probably need this modem later today. So now I’m like you took my perfectly good modem and left me with a non working? Did you know that it didn’t work before you installed?
2017-11-16 09:49:25,Came and changed tv boxes. They decided we needed a new modem and now we don’t have internet.
2017-11-16 09:43:56,@Shawhelp maybe should teach techs ‘if it ain’t broke done fix it!’ OY what a royal pain this has all been.
2017-11-16 08:40:03,Thank you so much for being so quick to respond this morning!
2017-11-16 08:29:00,Ugh. Sorry to bother you. It seems to be working now after booting up my PC. Not sure why it was like that last night. It is plugged directly into the modem as there is no wifi adapter. pic.twitter.com/PMqHPpdiOk
2017-11-16 07:54:39,"I agree But! cable is failing and energy needed for things I can RAGE against. Android & Direc TV are gaining, even here in Hicksville.Our Media, especially online is weak, now there's the Fox News playbook I want to attack!"
2017-11-16 07:49:19,Debi just want watching is not good enough ... having a FOX product on your cable bill even if you do not watch the channel you are supporting FOX .. @Shawhelp Shaw should not force customers to buy FOX products

2017-11-15 23:20:47,"Issue isn't with you, it's with the broadcaster. They are doing something odd with their feed. Noticed the ads end up full width, but programming doesn't. When I change to maintain, it looks super narrow."
2017-11-15 22:48:20,I've done that. Every other channel stretches. This one channel only doesn't.

I called up in Oct and they said it will be adjusted in Nov Bill.. But it still shows up in Nov Bill
2017-11-14 20:23:57,Wifi. I didn’t my have anything plugged directly in.
2017-11-14 20:23:12,Nothing like getting harassing phone calls twice in one day from @Shawhelp trying to keep our business. Maybe if they’d paid this much attention to our complaints we wouldn’t have switched to @TELUS !
2017-11-14 20:21:38,"@Shawhelp our internet is super slow right now - can hardly load new tweets. I unplugged the modem and plugged it back in, but it did nothing. Any other ideas?"
2017-11-14 20:12:57,@Shawhelp Just wanted you to know that your service is absolute shit and I'll be switching ISP's as soon as I can. #supportsmallstreamers @TwitchSharer @TwitchOnline
2017-11-14 20:08:46,Ok thnx. I’ll check with hubby and get back to you. Thanks for the quick reply!
2017-11-14 20:03:47,@Shawhelp how much does it cost to just add Disney Junior channel?
2017-11-14 20:03:43,"Oh. No. I would be so disappointed. I'm not smart enough to stream online, my Shaw box is life."

2017-11-14 19:56:52,Daaaamn you @Shawhelp My cable box just rebooted in the middle of two recordings.
2017-11-14 19:33:36,"Spotty wifi , dropped connections etc. and also one of the TV boxes he hooked up doesn’t work. I’ve unplugged it many times still doesn’t work. Says Call Shaw to subscribe. He was here 3 months ago hooking it all up"
2017-11-14 19:06:57,The screen saver is even disturbing to view. It's rubbish. But again I'm comparing netflix/apple TV and it's night and day.
2017-11-14 19:05:22,It's imo unwatchable for me. Never noticed a problem with my old pvr boxes. On demand is the worst quality but overall right from the install I feel I've downgraded
2017-11-14 19:04:25,Seems to have done the trick.. Thanks
2017-11-14 19:03:54,Comparing 1080 content to Shaw HD content there is a noticeable difference in the two.
2017-11-14 19:01:23,All channels are disrupted
2017-11-14 19:01:04,Tv audio only.
2017-11-14 18:56:42,@Shawhelp the sound to my jets game is continually cutting out. Anyone else have this problem?
2017-11-14 18:48:08,#cdnpoli We do not want any Fox products on our cable @Shawhelp Shaw is forcing us to support FOX .. People do not pay for something you do not want. We are dropping SHAW over this issue. NO FOX Products SHAW !!
2017-11-14 18:44:10,The most basic cable package in my area via @Comcast only carries @FoxNews . I told them it was trash. I had to buy a more expensive package to get real news. Looking for other options.
2017-11-14 18:26:04,Wow it's really bad. I think I have to have a tech visit
2017-11-14 17:41:25,I was just wondering about this on my way home! Thanks for weighing in! Now I really have to think about it. hmmmmm

2017-11-14 15:43:23,Okay.. I know the modem would be needing a swap out if we go to the 150/15 plan. I have to plan this out a bit..trying to keep the hassle as minimal as possible. I know that other company is poking us about their fiber ;)
2017-11-14 15:38:31,Thanks!
2017-11-14 15:37:44,So in this time.. there will be network connectivity issues too correct?

2017-11-14 15:24:26,@Shawhelp have you released an update for the VOD app yet? It is still doing that credentials thing.
2017-11-14 15:04:56,Do we have any idea for bluesky @Shawhelp
2017-11-14 14:57:26,@Shawhelp - is anyone having issues getting mail in the last couple of hours?

2017-11-14 13:41:44,@Shawhelp hey do shaw stores offer refurbished HD boxes?
2017-11-14 13:04:38,I was told BlueSkyTV doesn't qualify as a referrable service. Did you ever get a 25$ referral credit?
2017-11-14 12:59:32,Just did. Can you recommend anything else? Not too sure what to do here

2017-11-14 11:13:03,We have an old (as in at least 5 years) Apple TV so no voice recognition. We may not even use it anymore now that we have Blue Sky!

2017-11-14 11:12:26,My plan was ages old and I'm still saving a ton of money. The old plans aren't that great.

2017-11-14 11:12:02,"Yeah it's definitely pretty cool! Especially because all our channels are different now so I legitimately don't know what channel our shows are on. But, fear not, I ask the remote to find it for me!"

2017-11-14 10:03:26,Hi! The Souvenir and Jazz Masters channels have switched to Franco Fêtes (438) and Holiday Favourites (428)
2017-11-14 10:02:07,Fun.
2017-11-14 10:01:55,You guys are awesome! We have a Christmas party we're hosting at work and the group requested Christmas music. We use Stingray via Shaw for our in-house music.
2017-11-14 10:01:18,No I don't.
2017-11-14 10:01:01,Well you guys might want to look into it. It's not fair to be paying for something if we aren't even getting it.

2017-11-14 09:43:25,C'mon @Shawhelp update your shaw on demand tv episodes! 3 weeks now and still no shows have been updated. Ridiculous! Why am I paying for this??
2017-11-14 09:41:34,Old school PVR so it's like night and day. It's definitely useful as all our channels are different now so I just search 'Walking Dead' (or whatever) and it finds it and I can setup the recordings or whatever rather than scroll through.
2017-11-14 09:40:30,Is it gimmicky or is it useful? I've been considering. Did you come from a gateway system or a Motorola pvr?
2017-11-14 09:39:54,Thank you for your prompt reply. Do you know what channel it will be on in the Calgary region?
2017-11-14 09:37:47,@Shawhelp Our cable provider forces us to buy FOX channels .. We should all have a choice when purchasing channels. We are going to have to drop SHAW because of our values .. NO FOX in our home

2017-11-14 08:52:18,This is our second one and it always drops wifi connections. It can't reach the second floor and has problems with too many devices
2017-11-14 08:32:14,And I guess there's no plan to make any available for sale? Shame.
2017-11-14 08:26:07,Y’all last night hubby and I upgraded to @Shawhelp Blue Sky TV and I don’t want to overstate things but it is LIFE CHANGING. You can change the channel with your voice!!

2017-11-14 06:14:32,@Shawhelp important direct message about a fraud/phising scam from your webmail services :)

2017-11-13 19:05:35,KSPS is a entirely different station from KCTS. Different schedule. Different Watermark....

2017-11-13 14:37:47,It'd be for a new outlet. So that charge would include parts & labour for the install?

2017-11-11 20:58:59,"You have to honour your agreement that renewed this morning, paid in full. I do not care why you changed and are demanding more money. pic.twitter.com/sjX1q3xoRl"

2017-11-11 20:40:16,"There was 112 dollars in acct before I started Morning transaction, now there is only 82 dollars with reversed plan 100???"
2017-11-11 20:37:50,"I had gone past my full speed allotment a few days ago, so this morning I changed plans as you suggested. I paid in full / see tweets. I had full speed internet minutes after I paid this morning so the account was changed and paid in full- now reversed with demands"

2017-11-11 14:14:29,All we have been doing since switching to Bluesky is running around and rebooting boxes. Very inconvenient when the boxes are tucked away behind TV’s. Horrible solution Shaw! Your last service call apparently was a waste of time

2017-11-10 10:42:37,"2 up, 4.5 down. I've been getting dropoffs as well. A reset of my modem seems to have dealt with the problem, as I'm not getting those bad results anymore, but I can't be certain of anything."
2017-11-10 10:35:17,"Troubleshooting requires knowing the cause, and I have no way to know what that is."
2017-11-10 10:30:30,@Shawhelp Saying my speed test results are lower than expected means nothing when you won't tell me WHY it's too low.
2017-11-10 10:24:05,@Shawhelp guess I'm going to @TELUS . Customer loyalty at Shaw means milk the cash cow
2017-11-10 10:20:19,"So can this impact the overall speed available to me? If there are enough Freedom users connected will I see an overall speed slowdown, wired and WiFi?"

2017-11-09 19:34:48,This happens alot! Here's your speed test pic.twitter.com/BF4Jw5yfAq
2017-11-09 19:32:14,No connection to internet with an Ethernet cable from the modem
2017-11-09 19:26:35,@shawhelp why is my wifi signal only providing less than 5% of the 25mbps speed that I am paying for? pic.twitter.com/OVybaNa0c6
2017-11-09 19:22:57,Yes my own router it’s an Asus AC3200 and I’ve reset both devices twice
2017-11-09 19:19:26,And my router doesn’t show any problems either pic.twitter.com/OTP8l8fkgd
2017-11-09 19:17:24,Thank you
2017-11-09 19:14:38,@Shawhelp are there internet service outages for the Windermere in South Edmonton?
2017-11-09 19:11:30,Will do. My downstairs tv works fine. Just the box upstairs having issues.
2017-11-09 19:08:31,Yes. Followed the on screen instructions. Then I get this. pic.twitter.com/T5InI3yGSQ
2017-11-09 19:08:14,@Shawhelp is the internet having issues in Sault Ste Marie?
2017-11-09 19:04:38,Talking to my TV is great but if it doesn't respond it doesn't matter. It's like having a teenager.
2017-11-09 19:02:56,We have had this issue several times in the last few weeks. It tells us to reset it. We try it and it takes several attempts but finally does reset. I like my old Shaw cable better.
2017-11-09 19:01:14,It tells me it is having issues connecting to the portal. I can continue watching the current program but not change channels or bring up the guide.
2017-11-09 18:56:55,@Shawhelp So everytime it snows or rains is my Shaw Bluesky going to not work properly??? Just curious.
2017-11-09 18:45:40,And the cable companies wonder why people are going to streaming. Show something we want.
2017-11-09 18:37:37,"Yea i called 220 bucks and i lost a month.There should be at least some game on! We live in canada, a hockey country! with many games on again and no access to any is pretty sad!"
2017-11-09 18:19:28,Sent!
2017-11-09 18:18:49,"Winnipeg, and another game blacked out. Actually all nhl games are blacked out right now. Bye Shaw ! If u can't have hockey i'm done! @Shawhelp"
2017-11-09 18:15:10,"@Shawhelp I can’t get an Internet connection tonight,the DS light keeps flashing on my modem. I tried the coaxial cable at the back already"
2017-11-09 18:11:52,"Nope, they aren't. Top one is sold, second and last light are flashing. I've also tried rebooting several times."
2017-11-09 18:08:26,"@Shawhelp does Thunder Bay, Ontario have an outage for Internet?"
2017-11-09 17:47:55,Good evening. This gentleman may not be a customer. He is referring to a next door neighbour and a cable across his driveway that Shaw laid so it would be the cable team.
2017-11-09 17:04:20,"We don't seem to have any Shaw Direct Satellite TV accounts for this address. Are you perhaps with Shaw Cable? If so our colleagues at @Shawhelp can assist! We would also recommend deleting that tweet for your own safety, as these replies are publicly visible. *fpl"
2017-11-09 16:44:19,Internet for the first time didn't drop as well... still very obviously slow service in that department too... been a frustrating few months with y'all
2017-11-09 16:40:06,I unplugged it and it reset.... it just sucks that we have had to do this so often! We haven't even been compensated for all the issues we've encountered! Is that up to us to make you offer something?!
2017-11-09 16:31:27,@Shawhelp ??? Just documenting another glitch... pretty laughable now that we stay on as a customer pic.twitter.com/yVRj9wlQCk
2017-11-09 15:37:27,yes agreed. And this is a recent occurrence. I've been able to connect recently to hotspots here.
2017-11-09 15:31:14,I will see if it works at another hotspot. The problem seems to be that this hotspot is not asking/prompting for user info. Can't even change the config to enter it.
2017-11-09 15:25:33,"Galaxy s6. And yes, I've done ""forget network"" several times."
2017-11-09 15:20:31,"yes I can see ShawOpen but cannot connect. Says Authentication error, even though I haven't entered and can't enter my uid/pwd info."
2017-11-09 15:10:10,@Shawhelp currently having an issue with connecting to ShawOpen. Are there known problems in Nanaimo?
2017-11-09 15:07:03,@Shawhelp Troy in Winnipeg took my Shaw internet help phone call. He fixed the problem like a boss in seconds flat. He hardly said a word. Thanks Troy. #wificall
2017-11-09 14:18:13,I'm thinking of returning as @Shawhelp isn't helpful
2017-11-09 12:50:38,Croatia Greece
2017-11-09 12:13:17,this link shows it wont be on tv. If you scroll down to the actual guide it says Croatia vs Greece.
2017-11-09 11:52:39,Thank you. It is listed as Greece v Croatia on my TV menu for the 11:30am game.
2017-11-09 09:11:11,"@Shawhelp #Airdrie is resolved. Thanks. Is there an RSS feed available for service interruptions? If there is, I can't find it."

2017-11-08 22:05:55,@Shawhelp why isn't BBC World News in HD on Shaw? You barely have any HD channels. Have you seen Telus? 2x the number of HD channels compared to you. Don't make me switch to them.

2017-11-08 17:39:42,@Chuckw12 Our cable provider @Shawhelp would not help us drop Fox products. We are switching providers so that we do not have to support FOX in anyway.
2017-11-08 17:37:52,"I'm a SASKTEL customer. I have zero interest in your service, and definitely never will use it now. Do the people at the phones just forget when people tell them NO TY NOT INTERESTED. And then tell them the NEXT time they call, to PLEASE STOP CALLING ME?"

2017-11-05 14:12:43,"Okay, I will tell them, thanks. Is it possible to order a new Gateway from Shaw? She said she phoned Shaw and was referred to BestBuy."
2017-11-05 14:07:03,Interesting. So it would be pretty risky ordering online from BestBuy then? No indication of previous years of use. Says check with Shaw
2017-11-05 14:02:54,Apparently it's blacked out in BC. Silly NHL. Thanks for your help!
2017-11-05 14:00:15,"Excellent! Ps. If they buy the refurbished Gateway from Best Buy, what is the warranty? BestBuy said the warranty is with Shaw."
2017-11-05 14:00:06,Is it possible to watch on a laptop then? Or no?

2017-11-05 13:55:43,They don't care if they are interconnected. Just want to add a 3rd PVR to their setup without losing their other PVRs and the recorded shows
2017-11-05 13:54:45,I am asking for a friend. They have one Pace and one Motorola PVR I believe. They simply want to add a TV to their house with a Gateway pvr
2017-11-05 13:46:28,"@Shawhelp If you buy a new Shaw Gateway Box, can you just add it to a new TV and keep using your existing PVRs and all their recordings?"

2017-11-05 13:05:07,1/Here are some quotes from @Shawhelp (or non help) from the Chinook retail store today: ‘we don’t do tech. We don’t even know who to call.’
2017-11-05 12:50:52,Will do.. thanks
2017-11-05 12:47:42,I have no TV listings & can’t access my DVR. And I just have to suck it up while missing all my shows because @Shawhelp can’t make it out to fix the problem for 8 days #customerservicefail
2017-11-05 12:44:42,I was going to do updates but the speed was horrible so I stopped and then did the speedtest. :\

2017-11-05 12:41:07,"no TV or WiFi. Just says one moment please on TV screen. The word hunt appears on the box, it did for a while"
2017-11-05 12:39:57,Yes. Even checked tomorrow's listings. All there. The white swirl instead of series record is on all pre-sets. Fixd one but not the others.
2017-11-05 12:36:14,@Shawhelp are there issues in Sault Ste Marie?
2017-11-05 12:29:08,Seems to be okay today.. Just not the most fun when you're trying to do updates ;)
2017-11-05 12:26:20,Hey @Shawhelp - where is the NHL Network?
2017-11-05 12:21:14,i'm getting the same error message telling me to power cycle it again. clearly this isn't working. the main box and my other portal are tho
2017-11-05 12:16:47,Happy. Took a few minutes to get back the TV listings. Recordings are back. Not my pre-set to record. Still have a white swirl.
2017-11-05 12:08:27,@Shawhelp One of my BlueSky portals is stuck on the welcome screen. I've tried power cycling it 3 times now and still get the same result.

2017-11-05 11:17:11,I would like to have a month to preview it.
2017-11-05 11:06:00,How much is Sunday ticket per month @Shawhelp

2017-11-04 22:16:30,Kinda late I think. I suspect you won't be charging me.
2017-11-04 22:14:10,I will like to have a refund on my account.
2017-11-04 22:09:46,@Shawhelp how are you going to make this right? Customers wanted to and couldn't watch UFC 217!!

2017-11-04 21:53:59,UNACCEPTABLE. Unless you can drastically lower our bills and FULL REFUND expect myself as well as im sure many others to switch to TELUS.
2017-11-04 21:50:25,Oh no... so sorry! One of the best ones I have seen in years!
2017-11-04 21:50:09,How?!

2017-11-04 21:34:21,@Shawhelp I am one of the Blue Sky people that can’t get the fight. “on hold” guy is telling me to go to 300 or 324 - I don’t have those
2017-11-04 21:33:56,Oh no! Really good one!
2017-11-04 21:33:51,We have a house full of people too and no UFC! What the hell! Had to pay a sitter and Shaw won’t pay me back for that!!
2017-11-04 21:33:38,"@Shawhelp don't worry Shaw, we ordered through IOS. Better not be showing on our bill. Took an hour for an ""investigation"" still no resolve."
2017-11-04 21:32:35,Thanks but we called in and they said it was some back end issue affecting it for a majority of customers.
2017-11-04 21:31:42,It’s not some customer it’s everyone on your blueskytv!!! @ShawInfo @shawhelp
2017-11-04 21:31:35,Ugh!!! @Shawhelp where is my UFC fight?

2017-11-04 21:30:36,On bluesky as well and not working. Cancelled it and just found a stream instead
2017-11-04 21:30:35,@shawhelp To Everyone looking for a refund. You have to contact THEM within 24-48 hours to get refund. They are not just giving us one.
2017-11-04 21:30:10,"Yeah she had to sign one. Telus just recently made it into my area, so switching for sure. We don’t have a contract."
2017-11-04 21:30:01,It’s been an hour and a half and still nothing! Come on @shawhelp
2017-11-04 21:29:24,"Me too, ordered it this morning. Can’t watch it. Guy on the Shaw “on hold message” is telling me to tune into 300 or 324 which I don’t have"

2017-11-04 21:17:50,@Shawhelp at this point you should be giving it away for free. This is ridiculous
2017-11-04 21:17:25,"Well apparently Telus is in our area now, so this justice our decision. We will be switching."
2017-11-04 21:16:59,Can't even watch it cause @Shawhelp has issues
2017-11-04 21:16:29,Hey @Shawhelp can you please get your shit together? Biggest #UFC event of the year and once again #BlueSky is garbage #Refund #TelusSwitch
2017-11-04 21:16:28,@Shawhelp Brutal pay-per-view service w/ Shaw tonight for UFC12. 8 people over. Custom UFC belt up for grabs. NO FEED! #Disappointed pic.twitter.com/JMLy1U7J9C
2017-11-04 21:16:03,So more than an hour into fights. On hold for 66mins. PPV still hasn’t loaded. Better not be charged for this BS. Thanks for nada @Shawhelp
2017-11-04 21:15:02,@Shawhelp Found a fix guys. Cancel Shaw services order @TELUS services
2017-11-04 21:13:27,We gave up and ordered it online. No patience for poor service when it's an event like this.
2017-11-04 21:12:30,Same issue for me too. Had to run out to the nearest pub. Better not be charged for it.
2017-11-04 21:11:47,We have a house full of people here. No PPV. This is fun. Thanks for ruining the night Shaw.

2017-11-04 21:10:21,Yup.
2017-11-04 21:09:38,Great!!! So we basically can't watch a fight we paid for? No issues with the last ppv we ordered so what changed ???
2017-11-04 21:09:21,Is blue sky some sort of fancy meth?
2017-11-04 21:09:08,Surprised
2017-11-04 21:09:03,Will you replay it for all of us that are missing it!!!
2017-11-04 21:08:50,So we are getting it for free then??
2017-11-04 21:08:41,Shaw support chat just decided to disconnect on me after sending me a link to the support page...that's fun.
2017-11-04 21:08:41,Blue sky always f’s up —
2017-11-04 21:08:32,@Shawhelp I sent a direct message. Just wanted to make sure I’m not getting charged for the UFC fight as I can’t access it
2017-11-04 21:08:03,@Shawhelp start streaming it for us to watch
2017-11-04 21:07:50,No actually.
2017-11-04 21:07:34,Yup same here. Super pissed off
2017-11-04 21:07:15,Blue sky is the worst provider I’ve ever had. So disappointed and can’t wait to get out of my contract
2017-11-04 21:06:58,Is there any hope it will be on before the end of the fights? I'm still expecting a full refund either way
2017-11-04 21:06:37,Not a good start to our “new” BlueSky experience!
2017-11-04 21:06:37,Please check your dm
2017-11-04 21:06:13,@Shawhelp Same issues here. Bluesky not getting a signal even though order was confirmed

2017-11-04 21:04:38,@Shawhelp Can you please help me access the GSP fight? Getting black screen. Thanks!
2017-11-04 21:04:26,We better not have to pay for this... already missed an hour of the fights
2017-11-04 21:04:23,And everyone here knows it’s gonna take 4-6 months to fight them to take the charges off

2017-11-04 21:03:38,@Shawhelp HOW DO YOU GUYS LET THIS HAPPEN WITH YOUR PAPER VIEWS!?!?!? THIS IS NOT A GOOD LOOK!!
2017-11-04 21:03:22,No point in waiting anymore! Let me know if there will be refunds.
2017-11-04 21:03:14,I ran home because we have an old box and it worked... I ditched the party to come home and watch it. They are going to have to refund a lot
2017-11-04 21:02:31,"Oh also while thinking about it, the number your screen tells me to call (1-844-622-7429) is out of order, in case you weren’t aware..."
2017-11-04 21:02:26,There's no order button anymore. We've tried everything and after an hour on hold we hung up. Read that Shaw is telling people to just wait
2017-11-04 21:02:18,Still not working! Tried everything!
2017-11-04 21:02:10,Same here. @shawhelp
2017-11-04 21:02:09,@shawhelp really crapped the bed with this one... PPV is already an hour in and I’m sure 1000’s of people have houses full and no #UFC217
2017-11-04 21:01:49,I’m in the same boat. Black screen.
2017-11-04 21:01:09,I've given up on shaw and ordered on iOS. I'll be expecting a refund if I see a charge on my bill.
2017-11-04 21:01:07,"So, full refunds for this disaster? This is embarrassing."
2017-11-04 21:00:57,It better not be on the bill...
2017-11-04 21:00:39,"Don’t even bother I don’t want it even if it comes up, we are going to a bar in town that has it now"
2017-11-04 21:00:24,Come on!!!
2017-11-04 21:00:06,@Shawhelp Jesus Christ it’s been a hour and the UFC isn’t on yet

2017-11-03 17:14:37,Running a wired connection.
2017-11-03 17:11:58,Yup powered down for 30 seconds and plugged it back in.
2017-11-03 17:07:22,@Shawhelp I pay for 150. Earlier today I saw 5 Shaw trucks a block down from me. Any explanation? Live in northwest Winnipeg. pic.twitter.com/KKN5BFPuxi
2017-11-03 15:44:24,@Shawhelp Any chance someone could help me with finding out where my rebate check is?
2017-11-03 15:03:00,"@Shawhelp terrible service, your tech's missed 2 appointments to come to my house to switch me from @TELUSsupport you rescheduled me contd.."
2017-11-03 14:47:57,Fix my cancelled appt and compensate me for the day I took off work!
2017-11-03 14:37:02,"I think it was a problem with my phone. I tried calling back several times and actually could hear someone, but they could not hear me. #ok"
2017-11-03 14:35:41,"@Shawhelp my internet is incredibly slow today. I’ve power cycled the gateway and the cable modem, is there an issue in Edmonton?"
2017-11-03 14:14:17,"@Shawhelp In the middle of a call regarding special promotion, I got cut off, now number won't work. What do I do?"
2017-11-03 13:25:38,@Shawhelp I’m out of service in Canmore Alberta. Is there any known issues for Canmore?
2017-11-03 13:20:45,@Shawhelp one of your lines is down in Thunder Bay. It's literally on this car in our parking lot. pic.twitter.com/q4GDDbKChQ

2017-11-03 11:28:23,@Shawhelp would mild snow cause the internet provided by you to drop? if not care to explain why my internet keeps dropping this morning?
2017-11-03 11:00:05,@Shawhelp Hi Shaw! Our business Internet and phone is down in North Saanich. We've rebooted the router etc but no love. Please check it out!

2017-11-03 06:52:15,Did this get resolved? If not i think @thedylanoid should change from @TELUS to @Shawhelp . @telus you fucked up
2017-11-03 04:41:01,"Good folks at @Novusnow , Antonia. Used them for years here at Stately Chapman Manor."

2017-11-02 23:46:15,@Shawhelp wondering why my phone doesn’t alert me (tone or flashing light) when I have a vmail. It used to but doesn’t anymore. :(
2017-11-02 23:38:33,"anyone elses @Shawhelp cable/internet down? or am i the only one? ""signal loss detected"" i didn't touch anything"
2017-11-02 22:42:58,Yep. Power cycled the router and modem. Internet has been super spotty the last few days.
2017-11-02 22:39:53,@Shawhelp is internet down in NW calgary?
2017-11-02 22:04:55,@Shawhelp @TSN_Sports Meanwhile.... tennis is on 2 other TSN feeds. This is ridiculous. And happens way too often. Why do I even have cable?
2017-11-02 22:03:40,@Shawhelp @TSN_Sports For the THIRD day in a row I recorded @PTI & again it’s not there cause tennis is going way over it’s time.........
2017-11-02 21:57:42,Speeds are way down and tank out fairly often. There was a shaw truck in the complex 20 minutes ago
2017-11-02 21:52:35,@Shawhelp is there a service issue in east abbotsford tonight?
2017-11-02 21:32:20,@Shawhelp do you have problems in Calgary or am I just the lucky one to get disconnected?
2017-11-02 21:21:29,"Thx , just responded"
2017-11-02 21:11:44,"Thank you ! My modem is very old , is it possible to switch it ? This happens quite often , I keep rebooting it from time to time"

2017-11-02 19:54:18,@Shawhelp Wifi been down for a couple days now. Help!
2017-11-02 19:35:05,. @ShawHelp Lemme get this straight: You can't look up info about an area outage without subscriber info? Comcast could do this 10 years ago.
2017-11-02 19:22:09,I use Shaw and they are a cut above. They even reply on twitter.
2017-11-02 19:18:11,@Shawhelp haven't had my cordless phone connected when I plug it in it says no line. Also no tv as it says no gateway portal. Assistance?
2017-11-02 19:16:46,@Shawhelp if my internet was mistakenly shut down would it take you 3 days to turn back on like @TELUS . Asking for a friend
2017-11-02 19:16:24,"Thanks Steph from @Shawhelp -- my Internet is set up and my HD signal is solid! Rockstar service, even if you're not bald. :) #grateful"
2017-11-02 19:13:27,@TELUSsupport clearly sucks. Maybe they don’t give a shit about their customers like @Shawhelp does
2017-11-02 19:05:19,Thank you!!!
2017-11-02 19:05:15,Hello Phedra-Lyn ! Looks like your signal is cutting out due to accumulated snow on the dish. Plz DM us for more info on fixing this. :) *ml
2017-11-02 19:00:18,@Shawhelp is it possible to fast toward through commercials/30 seconds at a time w blue sky? Also there's no stop button is there?
2017-11-02 18:55:51,Hey @Shawhelp what’s up with my satellite?? Been glitchy like this on every channel since we got all the snow #annoying pic.twitter.com/Xs9CdS7HuH
2017-11-02 18:54:19,I didn’t want to make changes I wanted to watch the game on the channel I get as planned. Should have given free SN360 last eve
2017-11-02 18:48:05,I’m on the way home now. My wife texted me about the internet. I’ll check tv when I get there.
2017-11-02 18:46:11,And by that I mean she seemed very confused as to what I wanted to do. It was weird.
2017-11-02 18:45:09,We have cable. I’m concerned because I adjusted my tv options today and the agent was less than helpful.
2017-11-02 18:41:36,@Shawhelp is there an internet outage for the Killarney area of Vancouver?
2017-11-02 18:19:28,@Shawhelp we haven’t even had the call back option. Please let me know. We have urgent questions. Thanks
2017-11-02 18:18:55,"Pretty disappointed with Shaw right now. We’ve been trying to call for 2 days now, been on hold for 1hr 40 so far. What’s going on? @Shawhelp"
2017-11-02 18:08:20,@Shawhelp the shows I pvr’d are either not New like it states or the wrong show altogether
2017-11-02 17:57:55,"@Shawhelp What’s up with the onscreen listings for BBC Earth, they’ve been a mess for days."
2017-11-02 17:55:50,"I'm switching to Telus, should have a long time ago. You treat your long term customers like garbage!"
2017-11-02 16:50:42,@Shawhelp is there an internet outage in cloverdale. My internet is out
2017-11-02 15:05:50,"@Shawhelp Do you know why I would suddenly have a problem today signing in to my Shaw on Demand app? It's making me sign in, then tells me I don't have access to the service. But I can still access my On Demand stuff on the TV as usual."
2017-11-02 14:05:18,@Shawhelp any reason why cable and internet would be down in Surrey bc right now?
2017-11-02 13:51:59,Hello @shawhelp . I sent you a DM. Can you please check. Thanks.
2017-11-02 13:34:29,@Shawhelp Hi we have noticed a lot of static on our home phones lately. Is there anything that we can try try to clear this up?

2017-11-02 12:06:30,"@Shawhelp our internet is down for 3rd time today. We're trying to work, what is going on?"
2017-11-02 11:49:19,Wife fixed it. Just needed to reset gateway bix. Thanks Phil!
2017-11-02 11:40:09,Thanks...my wife is calling in. Im at work so Ill let her handle it. Was just curious if it was systematic or just isolated.
2017-11-02 11:30:48,@Shawhelp Is there a problem with the cable in Britnell NE Edmonton? Havent had cable signal all day.
2017-11-02 11:15:49,@Shawhelp Internet really slow in Sth Surrey right now. Paying for 150 but only get 67 w/ direct link to modem. Traffic? weather? aliens?
2017-11-02 10:42:34,How do I disconnect my iPhone from Shaw open? It’s totally useless. I’ve tried forgetting the network but no luck. @Shawhelp

2017-11-02 09:54:28,Shaw doesn’t care!!!
2017-11-02 09:53:52,Why black it out. Thought you had a licence to broadcast????
2017-11-02 09:52:05,Do you really think shaw gives a crap!!! Not likely!
2017-11-02 09:28:50,Got overcharged by Shaw and have to get credit because of it ... hopefully it's finance dept. Will approve a refund @Shawhelp
2017-11-02 08:34:42,download is at 4 where it should be 20?? It's been like this forever I'm getting jipped. It's a game on my ps4.
2017-11-02 08:30:31,@Shawhelp Why the hell does it take 17hrs to download a 50gb file huh? I've tried to get assistance dozens of times but no change hello?????
2017-11-02 08:21:43,Exactly!!
2017-11-02 08:10:16,Thanks!
2017-11-02 06:50:46,@Shawhelp when will the fireplace channel make an appearance?
2017-11-02 05:12:09,You mean you’re missing the Penguins game
2017-11-02 04:11:49,Snow Very wet & heavy ...Snow! VERY windy too. Glad we switched to @Shawhelp . Even if we DON'T get all the HD channels #NoSignalLoss #fb
2017-11-02 01:27:42,"@Shawhelp DS light is off, US light is flashing on modem. Tried unplugging power, coax and using reset button. Is it something on your end?"
2017-11-02 01:18:23,Dammit @Shawhelp I was 5 minutes from the end of that episode when the internet died. Could you please time your outages better. Thanks.
2017-11-01 23:38:02,@Shawhelp is your server down? I'm in the Winnipeg maples area and the modem seemed to have just stopped sending ping.
2017-11-01 23:32:30,. @Shawhelp there any outages in Winnipeg or is it just my internet?
2017-11-01 23:29:03,fuck you @Shawhelp
2017-11-01 23:14:17,Hahaha different kind of stress. Next 10 games are crucial
2017-11-01 23:11:09,Tell me if this is also your experience. Being an Oilers fan has been way more stressful than raising an infant child.
2017-11-01 22:47:35,@cnoelmedia Lenny: automated responses to telemarketers https://www. reddit.com/r/itslenny/ Now we need one for calls to @Shawhelp
2017-11-01 22:26:32,Feels bad when shaw gets blamed for the nhl's blackout restrictions
2017-11-01 22:19:01,Or a problem with the TV or PVR for the same reasons.
2017-11-01 22:18:30,I honestly don't think it's the signal. I do not think I've ever seen this issue on CBC. It doesn't happen with any other show or sport.
2017-11-01 22:15:27,I need a 2-1 canucks win because my fantasy team has Markstrom and Hirscher
2017-11-01 22:13:19,It only seems to be Sportsnet related. I'll wait until a game is on both CBC and a SN and see if I can't determine if it's the channel.
2017-11-01 22:07:00,Doesn’t help one bit when you thought you recorded Canucks game on sportnet and then find out you have recorded the World Series twice#telus
2017-11-01 22:05:35,"Also, despite my having done nothing to the cable or the TV it seems to have ceased doing it."
2017-11-01 22:05:01,"This happened to me too, infuriating!"
2017-11-01 22:04:55,"Funnily enough, we do not have any other boxes in the house, not sure why you always think we do."
2017-11-01 22:01:48,It’s called game 7 of the #WorldSeries2017
2017-11-01 21:54:02,Unfortunately the PVR is suffering anyway and cannot be relied on to show even the non jerky play reliably.
2017-11-01 21:53:24,"It happens all over the ice, but is reasonably guaranteed to happen each time the play crosses through the neutral zone."
2017-11-01 21:52:00,Yeah I saw your tweet and went on the hunt and also found it!
2017-11-01 21:46:04,@Shawhelp I just got my bill for the month and it says I ordered a UFC event that I never watched. Why would I order a month old event?
2017-11-01 21:41:12,Each of the first 3 or 4 times I've brought it up with you all. It happens just too often at the same spots on the ice to be the connection
2017-11-01 21:39:18,That was the last straw @Shawhelp I'm switching to @TELUS tomorrow. For real.
2017-11-01 21:39:10,Ended*
2017-11-01 21:39:03,"I finally got it, after the Oilers game end."
2017-11-01 21:38:31,"I'm in Van. If you don't have an alternate channel, you won't see the game tonight. Yet the World Series are on all the channels."
2017-11-01 21:38:22,I PVR the @EdmontonOilers game on @Shawhelp ch 23 @Sportsnet cuz that's what guide said. Instead it's a fucking MLB game. Who's to blame?
2017-11-01 21:35:41,"...speed and cuts frames or something, but I have no setting like that set. I'm fairly sure that it gets sent by you or Sportsnet this way."
2017-11-01 21:34:27,It's nothing to do with that. The TV has no other signal problems on any other channels. It is possible that the TV can't handle...cont...
2017-11-01 21:28:16,@Shawhelp . You must be part of the a government sector. Cause you don’t do anything and charge me $250/month. I hate u!
2017-11-01 21:22:28,@Shawhelp the Canucks game on 302 is doing that jerky movement thing that I've been complaining about.
2017-11-01 21:21:37,"As soon as the Oilers/Penguins game ended. ""Last minute changes"" #pathetic @Shawhelp"
2017-11-01 21:20:47,You people are Stellar and Wonderful TYVM
2017-11-01 21:17:01,"Hey there, it's on SN Vancouver tonight. Here's where you can find it: http://www. sportsnet.ca/schedule pic.twitter.com/UYUVSbBfbI"
2017-11-01 21:15:25,@Sportsnet @Canucks @Shawhelp trying to watch Canucks vs Devils...what channel #joke #sad
2017-11-01 21:11:21,Okay.
2017-11-01 21:10:41,"Ok it is what it is, sorry for being snarky I love my Canucks!"
2017-11-01 21:09:39,What channel @Shawhelp @Canucks
2017-11-01 21:07:17,Would love to watch the Devil's decimate the Canucks. Shame.
2017-11-01 21:03:31,Just a notice of blackout restrictions. No need to show Leafs on multiple channels and screw Canuck fans. #comeonman
2017-11-01 21:01:37,Way to go Shaw you screwed us again. I PVRd the wrong game thanks to you. Why do you keep doing this? Get your act together
2017-11-01 20:57:52,"Yeah, sorry, I misread. That sucks."
2017-11-01 20:57:26,@Shawhelp I just got CraveTV thru Shaw. Can I access it on my laptop when not at home?
2017-11-01 20:57:24,Hahaha no worries
2017-11-01 20:57:15,Yeah but you're in BC. It's not available for people outside of BC.
2017-11-01 20:56:58,"That's ridiculous! My on tv guide shows the game on Sportsnet 360. Multiple channels showing Leafs game, so that's B.S."
2017-11-01 20:56:56,Nope sorry I misunderstood your question.
2017-11-01 20:56:34,I've got it showing as channel 22 at 8.
2017-11-01 20:54:17,
2017-11-01 20:53:50,Yes. Which is a Vancouver/BC channel
2017-11-01 20:53:33,20 channels are playing the damn world series and I can't have one that I pay extra for. Utter bullshit.
2017-11-01 20:52:12,In the past when there was schedule issues they put the game on PPV channel
2017-11-01 20:49:53,Looking for this game in Sask. Not necessary to show the damn Leafs on multiple channels is it? Where is the Canucks game I paid for?
2017-11-01 20:47:05,Unacceptable! You’ve screwed us again Shaw. Shame on you.
2017-11-01 20:46:38,It's on Sportsnet Vancouver Hockey
2017-11-01 20:45:32,I'm a huge #Devils fan and this is completely unacceptable. Why am I paying for it??
2017-11-01 20:45:15,nope
2017-11-01 20:45:11,"How is it that in an era of 5 TSN channels and 127 SN variations, there are any blackouts. Especially in the fantasy sports era we live!"
2017-11-01 20:44:04,I experience this multiple times a year and it gets old really quick. Blackouts are complete crap
2017-11-01 20:43:09,So I had plans and people over to watch the game that was advertised. This crap is why people don't pay for cable anymore
2017-11-01 20:43:04,Telus too girl. Pissed.
2017-11-01 20:42:31,I was told I could watch it on freerange tv. I don't pay $54 a month to watch games on my phone
2017-11-01 20:41:59,@Shawhelp tell me this isnt for real. We cant get the first period of @canucks games now ?
2017-11-01 20:39:47,@Shawhelp complete bullshit advertising games on subscribed channels then changing programming and blacking out other options for game
2017-11-01 20:38:59,So I need to move to B.C. to watch the Devils play? Ok...
2017-11-01 20:34:54,@Sportsnet @Shawhelp @Canucks get your collective shit together and stick to a channel for Canucks games... #brutal #Idiots
2017-11-01 20:34:41,Then make 360 free tonight. Simple fix.
2017-11-01 20:33:04,Are you serious?
2017-11-01 20:32:59,"Hey @Shawhelp , your guide info is wrong. Game is listed on incorrect channels. I Found it on 302 because of this tweet."
2017-11-01 20:32:32,@Sportsnet @Shawhelp ok sports companies. Make this a channel. But get rid of the background and make it full 16*9 ratio #pipwasamazing pic.twitter.com/3cIRIpqGs3

2017-11-01 20:31:29,And stream is screwed by @ShawHelp . You guys really need to fix your http:// twitch.tv issues.

2017-11-01 20:27:28,Center Ice blacks out your local team.. Otherwise everyone would dump @Shawhelp & @TELUS
2017-11-01 20:27:16,i can't find the game in Vancouver either
2017-11-01 20:26:22,@sportsnet @Canucks @Shawhelp Tough to sell your product when we cant watch the damn game? No #leafs in this house!
2017-11-01 20:25:12,HEY! 302 & 326 is dead air! I live in AB and paid for Centre Ice to watch the Canucks. Wasn’t an issue vs Dallas Monday. Fix this now.
2017-11-01 20:24:42,Hahaha are you guys even going to make the playoffs this year....
2017-11-01 20:24:21,Thanks for this! :) Couldn't get it on 326 and couldn't find it anywhere else.

2017-11-01 20:16:32,"So... the game won't be shown on Sportnet, which I pay for, nor the NHL cable package, which I also pay for? Nice."
2017-11-01 20:16:25,Well that channel is not working at my place. I thought it would be that channel. Can you help?
2017-11-01 20:16:22,302 and 326 are both blank in Edmonton saying Not Subscribed (I do have the ice pack).
2017-11-01 20:16:16,Liars. Where the hell is the Oilers game???
2017-11-01 20:15:11,302 tells me I'm not subscribed to that channel.
2017-11-01 20:15:05,Im missing my game for some wack ass sport that nobody cares about atm... and gamecentre wont let me stream because its broadcast locally
2017-11-01 20:15:03,360 should be enabled on a free preview then for tonight in Alberta
2017-11-01 20:15:02,It's on 328
2017-11-01 20:14:42,How uninformed are you? It's on SN360. Guide says Devils vs Canucks and no subscription necessary. I give up. @shawnohelp
2017-11-01 20:14:12,Tried all of them and nada.
2017-11-01 20:14:06,Apparently its only showing up on SNP and SN360... i went through the whole guide even ppv and whatnot...
2017-11-01 20:13:58,Hahaha Nate you know the Leafs are the truth...
2017-11-01 20:13:57,Thank you
2017-11-01 20:13:08,I'm in Manitoba... nothing but dead air on both 302 and 326.
2017-11-01 20:12:54,Thanks! We were floundering!!
2017-11-01 20:12:33,. @Shawhelp HELP! Which channel is the #Canucks game on for centre ice subscribers?
2017-11-01 20:12:18,@Shawhelp where is the Canucks game? Says Canucks vs Devils and the Oilers game is on pic.twitter.com/i1nOUCYxWz
2017-11-01 20:12:00,@Shawhelp guide says it on 223 but Baseball game is on. So because sportsnet changed things I'm out of luck?
2017-11-01 20:11:54,Leafs a Trash ting fam
2017-11-01 20:11:16,Go Leafs Go
2017-11-01 20:10:55,I absolutely loathe people selling stuff door to door. @TELUS @Bell @Shawhelp stop this or I will never buy from you & will sell my shares
2017-11-01 20:10:16,Where’s the Canucks game? It was supposed to be on 360!
2017-11-01 20:08:47,What about the Devils/Canucks?
2017-11-01 20:08:28,U people had this so screwed up this evening. Time to look at an alternative provider. Fed up with inaccurate guides. And I PAY ENOUGH!
2017-11-01 20:07:13,@Shawhelp where is the Canucks game on Shaw for people not in BC?
2017-11-01 20:06:21,What channel is the Oilers game on. @Shawhelp

2017-11-01 20:04:34,"Don't have 302 and it says I have to subscribe for 326. I've been able to watch it on 326 before without a problem. ""Info"" just gives me a"

2017-11-01 20:01:57,"It’s super weird. We even reset the modem and router and can only get the 5GZ working. Oh well, at least one does!"
2017-11-01 19:53:04,Can I get a follow for dm’s
2017-11-01 19:50:38,So how do I get 360?
2017-11-01 19:49:27,@Shawhelp Not everyone wants to give you more money for less and less - Oilers game on SN360 that I don't want to pay for. Boo Shaw!
2017-11-01 19:47:42,Thanks mate!
2017-11-01 19:47:30,Yeah not quite sure what in paying for these days. And I have a pretty robust package.
2017-11-01 19:47:01,You guys suck! Who cares about a baseball game between 2 teams thousands of miles away.
2017-11-01 19:46:51,Everyone can direct their displeasure to feedback@sportsnet.rogers.com @sportsnet
2017-11-01 19:45:56,@Shawhelp any help getting the oilers game tonight? I have sports net but can’t find the game anywhere
2017-11-01 19:45:15,Dealt with Lance many times #AlwaysPrompt via DM’s
2017-11-01 19:44:53,You're right
2017-11-01 19:44:49,Jk
2017-11-01 19:44:36,I guess we'll fine out in 15 minutes
2017-11-01 19:43:45,That's great... now call @shawhelp and get them to unlock the channel since we should have been able to watch this game without subscribing
2017-11-01 19:42:42,"I'm just having a rough night and wanted to relax by watching my favorite team play, but now my night is just more stress."
2017-11-01 19:41:17,pic.twitter.com/4XWO8l1ppu
2017-11-01 19:41:01,Is there any other way to watch it other way than to pay for it? I'm quite annoyed that they are prioritizing poker and baseball over hockey
2017-11-01 19:40:31,I would some pissed off if I had PVR’s a game and it was on the wrong channel... the only reason that have satelite. Not impressed
2017-11-01 19:40:27,+A to @Shawhelp great customer service
2017-11-01 19:39:33,Thank you! I’m so tired of Shaw’s guide not being correct.
2017-11-01 19:37:12,"Ah, in that case I'll need to call on our colleagues from @Shawhelp and they'll be happy to help you out :) *fpl"
2017-11-01 19:35:08,anything now? I'd like to get this fixed
2017-11-01 19:34:57,I got it back by connecting to my 5Ghz connection. Maybe just too much interference tonight.
2017-11-01 19:34:41,Literally have four channels that say the oilers game is playing on the @Shawhelp guide but not a single one has the game on.
2017-11-01 19:34:24,Sent!
2017-11-01 19:33:52,Frustrating
2017-11-01 19:33:36,Shaw should turn on SN 360 for all Edmonton customers for the game?
2017-11-01 19:31:44,@Shawhelp @Canucks i believe the game is being played on channel 231 (SN360). Not 302! correct me if I'm wrong/insane
2017-11-01 19:30:32,"So I guess I can't watch the #EDMvPIT on Shaw TV, remind me again why I have Shaw again @Shawhelp"
2017-11-01 19:30:26,not sure why I have sent it twice and I don;t' really want to put all my private information on here
2017-11-01 19:29:55,But you could @Sportsnet that your client base is less than happy!
2017-11-01 19:29:03,"I’m in the car,just dropped off grandsons football gear and listening to between period chat on CHED...grrr"
2017-11-01 19:29:03,Same issue as everyone else here. What an absolute joke.
2017-11-01 19:28:37,Don't brother they are not showing the #Oilers
2017-11-01 19:27:17,@Shawhelp are you heading of any outages downtown Calgary? No internet here.
2017-11-01 19:26:27,Seriously @sportsnet @Shawhelp why is game not on sportsnet west. @EdmontonOilers is the only reason I pay for the sportsnet. Baseball
2017-11-01 19:25:37,@Sportsnet could have placed it on regional channels! Or on the special local Sportsnet channel like they do when Oiler/Flame sametime
2017-11-01 19:25:17,that's crooked. Just stop fishing for money as a company and fix it.
2017-11-01 19:24:16,"@Shawhelp Thank you, Shaw. The non-functioning wi-fi near Starbucks, Broadmead Mall, Victoria, is now fixed!!! I can tweet again!"
2017-11-01 19:24:07,sent
2017-11-01 19:24:06,Thats great for people who have shaw360... however i don't..
2017-11-01 19:24:03,"I see that, but you want extra money for that channel. SO, I don’t have it !That is what is BS"
2017-11-01 19:23:43,Disappointed-don't have SN360-premium.The #EDMvsPIT game was listed as being on my basic service-SN1. Listening on @630CHED -gr8 announcers
2017-11-01 19:23:27,How can you make a god that is Nate Coehoorn dm you for help?!? Just give the man his SN360!!
2017-11-01 19:23:03,End of 1st 0-0
2017-11-01 19:22:19,"I don’t subscribe to this channel, so now I can’t watch it? Ridiculous. SN360 never has Oilers games on it. @Shawhelp @Sportsnet"
2017-11-01 19:21:04,I need sports net 360. I’m missing the @EdmontonOilers game @Shawhelp
2017-11-01 19:20:00,"Also others are able to get the game in SD on 121 without subscription, but we don't."
2017-11-01 19:19:16,Still doesn't make sense they're showing plays of the month over current gameplay on Sportsnet One.
2017-11-01 19:14:45,@Shawhelp what channel is the pens oilers game?? It's all baseball
2017-11-01 19:14:07,"When channels r sampled for subscription it’s free for a wknd, can this work for the game? Will it be replayed?"
2017-11-01 19:14:02,@Shawhelp why is the TV guide saying that the @EdmontonOilers are playing on sportsnet1 yet there a poker game on??
2017-11-01 19:13:51,Yeah with internet 150
2017-11-01 19:13:26,"@Shawhelp I have no phone service, my phone says check tel line, whats up?"
2017-11-01 19:13:25,This is BS. meanwhile I can watch plays if the month??? WTF.
2017-11-01 19:13:08,"Ok, thanks"
2017-11-01 19:12:39,There were last-minute changes in Sportsnet's programming that came in too late to update the Guide. Pls DM for help finding a show! *fpl
2017-11-01 19:11:39,Best two players in the league being bumped off the cable feeds onto a subscription only channel.

2017-11-01 19:05:31,Actually I pay way too much for cable and I'm going to go basic or cancel anyway.
2017-11-01 19:05:22,. @ShawHelp Thank you to your guy Lance. This is the first time (of four) that I've been locked out of @WWENetwork & gotten prompt assistance
2017-11-01 19:04:39,That is garbage... put the premiere game of the week on a premium channel. Guess this is why I'm cutting the cord.
2017-11-01 19:04:36,@Shawhelp if you don't fix the oilers game on shaw your about to lose 1million peoples business...
2017-11-01 19:04:14,Gee thanks

2017-11-01 19:02:28,You do realize that it's Crosby vs McDavid and that that's more important than poker and baseball to the majority of Canadians right?
2017-11-01 19:02:14,@Shawhelp so you guys moved the oilers game to a channel I’m not subscribed to. Not happy and I think I’m done with Shaw.
2017-11-01 19:01:53,You basturd
2017-11-01 19:01:15,Good pick up with rabbit ears in Sherwood park !

2017-11-01 18:55:28,@Shawhelp @Sportsnet What channel is the Oilers game on tonight? All of the channels that list Oilers Vs Pens have poker or the World Series
2017-11-01 18:53:06,"So no ""free"" TV"
2017-11-01 18:52:34,It's not there. Just bars. And there's no blackout as it's in SNW ON REG CABLE. This is not satisfactory as I pay for Free range.
2017-11-01 18:51:36,Thanks!
2017-11-01 18:50:49,@Shawhelp https:// twitter.com/jaycole1977/st atus/925887701772935168 …

2017-11-01 18:48:18,"My cable guide is wrong. Trying to find the Oilers game, and every channel it says it should be on is just baseball."
2017-11-01 18:47:51,"@Shawhelp so I know the oilers game is on SN360, but I don't have those channels! Will the game be on the normal channels after poker?"
2017-11-01 18:46:30,Thx!
2017-11-01 18:46:28,I finally found it on 121 which is listed poker!! Baseball is on the xhannels@listed for hockey
2017-11-01 18:46:11,@Shawhelp I don’t get 360 it’s in a different package. When I signed up I was told I would get all the oiler games...
2017-11-01 18:45:41,@Shawhelp @EdmontonOilers hey where's the @OilersNation game on SHAW
2017-11-01 18:45:36,I don’t have a channel 231. I have hockey central and whole@package but that channel is not on my listings

2017-11-01 15:34:36,I've got signal loss on cable in Saskatoon as well.
2017-11-01 15:18:08,@Shawhelp just wondering if any work is happening in Saskatoon. Net keeps going down and coming back.
2017-11-01 14:50:08,@Shawhelp I can’t record the World Series through my gateway. Help! It’s a channel I know I get but it keeps saying error
2017-11-01 14:33:18,"My @Shawhelp calls keep dropping like flies. I call Shaw, what do they tell me? ""Insufficient Bandwidth"" how? They say, ""I don't know"""
2017-11-01 14:11:03,Hey @Shawhelp I remember a few years ago it was possible to get a 2nd IP address on your residential internet services. Still possible?
2017-11-01 13:20:33,12 days left before renewal. Data usage at 7.3 GB. Still well under max allowed for full speed internet.-have never gotten this far. #HGOHD

2017-11-01 11:13:42,"@Shawhelp any service issues affecting the South Surrey, BC area? Nothing listed on the website but TV and internet are out."
2017-11-01 11:07:59,It's still not showing on the guide though....channel 302 as usual correct???
2017-11-01 11:01:52,@Shawhelp @Sportsnet What's going on with tonights @Canucks game? Showing it starts at 8 on SNPacific? WRONG. Trying to record it as I work

2017-10-31 23:20:57,Sasktel. And I've had my internet go out probably over 10 times with them. And sometimes it was a few days. And they use the same excuse.
2017-10-31 23:14:33,What would you recommend then? I've been using Shaw internet for a few years and have no real issues with it.
2017-10-31 22:19:48,"Kinda too late, as long as we don't get bumped again tomorrow. But might i suggest not cold calling people you've bumped to sell tv?"
2017-10-31 21:44:58,We rebooted the modem and it still can’t find the server
2017-10-31 21:44:27,Internet is not working. Can’t find server when do speed test.

2017-10-31 20:37:31,@Shawhelp Shaw internet is either slow as a snail or completely down in Buckingham neibgourhood for last couples of days.
2017-10-31 20:37:18,I would never suggest @Shawhelp internet to anybody. Garbage.

2017-10-31 15:19:49,Now he's trying to tell me because he can't send a signal refresh (which I can engage manually from here) that I have to upgrade. This has nothing to do with my signal strength issue at all. What the hell?

2017-10-31 13:55:25,@Shawhelp hi you guys. Are you having internet issues downtown at all today? We are on 600 block of Fort. Have been having issues with our Shaw internet AND Shaw open
2017-10-31 13:48:52,I hope so cause I have to go to the bathroom and don’t want anyone telling me they came while I’m gone for a few minutes
2017-10-31 13:45:18,They said they’ll message him back. It’s frustrating
2017-10-31 13:41:47,waiting all day for @Shawhelp . Connection appointment was between 10-12pm. Called and told me they came and none is home. Ready since 9:30am
2017-10-31 13:12:54,"@Shawhelp Internet has been 50% speed for several days. Have rebooted modem, changed channel, etc. Online support chat is broken. Help?"
2017-10-31 12:43:58,OK Lance. It's better now. You have both fixed my problem and made me acutely aware of how badly I need to dust my entertainment unit.
2017-10-31 12:42:28,"Hi Lance. Unplugged. Plugged back in. Cable box is freaking out. Currently waiting on a ""PSLd"" message."

2017-10-31 12:12:26,Ha. Boring tree. Ours was multiple trees!! Fancy
2017-10-31 12:07:57,There used to be 2 channels. Log on one and trees with tunes on another. So you could mix it up depending on the day!
2017-10-31 11:51:43,@Shawhelp is there a problem with the internet in the calgary area getting really high latency and unstable latency when I was gaming today
2017-10-31 11:19:12,Do any of my Twitter peeps in #YMM have @Shawhelp 150 internet & what's the service like? Looking at switching from @TELUSsupport soon.
2017-10-31 11:07:08,Nope. Still the same after unplug. It’s only the Disney channel too from what I’ve seen.
2017-10-31 11:04:18,I miss the Christmas trees with the lights and the music too. The log fireplace is good but the crackling isn’t.
2017-10-31 11:00:29,it was the main West End location in Edmonton 104 ave and 178 Street.
2017-10-31 10:59:04,"Like it plays a bit of audio for two seconds and then the moment the picture loads, the sound disappears."
2017-10-31 10:58:02,"Every time I go back to it, it switches back to descriptive which is weird."
2017-10-31 10:55:56,So it turns the audio back on when I change it to English but I have to do it every time I flip to the channel? It was fine a few days ago
2017-10-31 10:49:29,Hi Lance! We have another box. It says ARRIS on it.
2017-10-31 10:32:24,@Shawhelp our Disney channel has no sound. It has been days?!?

2017-10-30 21:18:46,but I honestly think you'd have less frustrated customers if you communicated better that there are 2 options available to watch OOM games.
2017-10-30 21:15:43,because I realize that the NHL & Rogers/Sportsnet ultimately are the ones to blame about the separation of the 2 services.

2017-10-29 19:30:50,@Shawhelp Are you guys aware of a #BlueSkyTV bug that causes shows to record if they don't have a specific episode number in the guide listings? Been happening with Lucifer and a few other shows.

2017-10-29 11:18:53,Day 26 without internet. @shawhelp doesn't respond anymore. I constantly hum songs from my ISP's hold music. A node migration caused this.

2017-10-27 17:02:18,Day 24 without internet. My modem's MAC address is now in the hands of @Shawhelp for a backend check. Hope to hear back this weekend.

2017-10-27 17:00:54,"@Shawhelp Congrats #ShawCable , you have lost a 16 yr loyal customer for both tv and internet due to absolutely awful customer service."

2017-10-27 16:58:36,Yes this is wifi for sure.
2017-10-27 16:55:47,"@Shawhelp no need for help,wish i dropped off modem to PG office in a bag of dog poop. #shawcable #dogpoop but i used ur mail label instead"

2017-10-27 15:52:55,@Shawhelp the only way to get any service from Shaw is to tweet about their bullshit #ShawSucks
2017-10-27 15:52:05,@Shawhelp shaw only cares until you move and cancel services. they dont care about loyalty ! #ShawSucks
2017-10-27 15:50:12,@Shawhelp i was wrong to delete previous tweet #ShawSucks after all

2017-10-27 08:37:01,@Shawhelp can you still get replacement Gateway remotes? I have one which doesn’t work anymore. Thank you!

2017-10-26 21:29:10,I tried turning off and on. No luck. So basic unplug? I should mention it's same message on both tvs.
2017-10-26 21:26:27,"@Shawhelp since this morning can't access any TV. Says ""an error occurred"" ensure media server functioning properly. Help!!"
2017-10-26 20:51:36,"@Shawhelp is there anything wrong with wifi signals in Richmond, BC?!"
2017-10-26 20:50:18,But I've been using it since free range came out. As its handy to have when wanting to watch a canucks game at the dinner table.
2017-10-26 20:49:19,"Yes, I'm logging in with my account info. It just says add account and then it will take up to 24 hours to activate."
2017-10-26 20:42:22,@Shawhelp did free range tv services change recently? I can't access it right now.
2017-10-26 20:39:15,"@Shawhelp Hi, how do I found my account number. Just got setup today but I also want to setup Go WiFi, FreeRange, when I’m out of the house."
2017-10-26 20:14:16,It is an issue on your side; I have spoken with Xbox directly. My speedtests go from normal to under 1mbps. #stoppassingthebuck
2017-10-26 20:13:25,Thanks!
2017-10-26 20:12:50,No wonder shaw is making people sign contracts now!!!!! The Cable TV signal is terrible!!

2017-10-26 19:02:58,"@Shawhelp What a joke, been on hold for hours in the last 2 days after trying to upgrade/transfer to new house, only to have a mess ensue."
2017-10-26 19:02:21,"alright, so why isn't there other programming on? I'm going to be charged for blackout channels for the next 6 months of hockey"
2017-10-26 18:50:04,"@Shawhelp @TSNHockey why are TSN2, TSN3, and TSN5 all blacked out in Edmonton? Last time I checked, I pay to watch sports, not blackouts!!"
2017-10-26 18:46:39,"Hey DH, already did that with no change. Running traceroutes are not showing any issues. Speedtests to multiple servers have the same issue."
2017-10-26 18:46:39,Yup internet works fine using other platforms just not the Nhl game centre app. But it works fine when I’m on data. Just odd it all
2017-10-26 18:42:18,Request has timed out. I tried resetting internet but still occurs. Wondering if it’s a new setting when internet was upgraded for free?
2017-10-26 18:36:15,@Shawhelp Hey are you guys having issues tonight? my 150Mbps connection is down to 1.5Mbps and I can't log in to your support site.
2017-10-26 18:34:23,"Me too, it is recording but it is criminal. Minds and not project runway. Bummed."
2017-10-26 18:32:53,@Shawhelp my internet won’t stream my Nhl game centre. Does this have anything to do with the change. It works fine on pone data
2017-10-26 18:28:54,@Shawhelp It says Project Runway is on Bravo but it’s some other show! Why is this and when/where is project runway?
2017-10-26 18:14:13,Did you take @HistoryVikings off VOD?? @Shawhelp ?? i can’t find it anywhere whyyyyy
2017-10-26 18:08:54,Why are there Blackouts in Effect on #TSN2 #TSN3 #TSN5 ??? @TSNHockey @TSN @Shawhelp #YYC
2017-10-26 17:48:17,@Shawhelp is there a ppv for the oiler game ?

2017-10-26 12:47:24,@Shawhelp @TSN_Sports there is no sound on TSN5. Not even during commercials
2017-10-26 12:45:27,Explain how logging in with a device is different than manually adding the MAC?
2017-10-26 12:16:57,I'm in Kitsilano and no Internet here. Same issue? By 'Downtown' do you mean central Vancouver?
2017-10-26 11:43:01,"@Shawhelp does the NBA League Pass that’s included if you have NBA TV give you access to the League Pass app too, or just the games on TV?"
2017-10-26 11:35:44,@Shawhelp why do i have no sound on TSN5
2017-10-26 11:10:43,"Thanks! Yes, currently shows as NFL football on Gateway app. I'll watch for it tomorrow."

2017-10-25 23:30:08,@Shawhelp was curious if you do Easy Own on Bluesky TV? Can you pick it up in retail and connect it yourself? Curious...
2017-10-25 23:01:32,You guys have a good sleep.
2017-10-25 22:11:13,@TELUS so same number but for both customer service has set hours and tech support 24/7. And you hung up on us. Switching to @Shawhelp pic.twitter.com/rlJpWcqEbt

2017-10-25 21:39:08,That red light flash was a new one... Did yours so it to?
2017-10-25 21:34:52,"Everything fine now, but at one point the blue light went red, there was something that was to fast for me to read and then it went dark."
2017-10-25 21:26:13,Sent the details via DM
2017-10-25 21:20:04,Hi all! Just got home and the remote for my Blue Sky didn't want to work. Lotsa juice so shut down main unit. Took 15 minutes to reboot!
2017-10-25 21:19:35,"@Shawhelp Don’t have internet from last two days, can I have technician early than my scheduled appointment?"
2017-10-25 21:13:45,Yes please.

2017-10-25 20:42:24,It appears to be working now thanks for your help
2017-10-25 20:34:37,I'll try that I forgot about that sorry
2017-10-25 20:31:38,Yes I have had to turn off the Wi-Fi on my phone the connection seems to be very unstable
2017-10-25 20:29:34,My tablet doesn't seem to be connecting as it tells me no internet connection
2017-10-25 20:27:12,"@Shawhelp ,I'm having trouble with my Wi-Fi don't know why"
2017-10-25 20:26:01,@Shawhelp I'm having real problems with my Wi-Fi help
2017-10-25 19:20:28,Hey @CRTCeng @CCTS_CPRST at what point does @Shawhelp need to make a third-party-provided internet outage a priority? Is 21 days enough?
2017-10-25 19:19:11,"Wired speeds ARE low, as I’ve said several times. Around 46 mbps. About the same as the wireless speeds."
2017-10-25 19:16:08,Thanks for your help. Have a good night!
2017-10-25 19:15:49,"I have to put my kids to bed. The internet is still quite useable, so we’ll come back to this later."
2017-10-25 19:14:40,I don’t think that’s the problem. Wired speeds aren’t that much faster than wireless. Thanks though.
2017-10-25 19:13:30,"Alas, that’s not the case. Wired speeds are only slightly faster at 47.65 mbps."
2017-10-25 19:12:08,"Ah, I see. Good point. Connection speed looks around the same for both."
2017-10-25 19:10:30,"Over wifi. Haven’t tried a wired connection lately. But most of our internet devices are wifi, so that’s what I care about most."
2017-10-25 19:09:16,Is it because of location? Are you not able to provide as fast service in rural locations like Vegreville?
2017-10-25 19:08:27,No. Still around 43 mbps.
2017-10-25 19:06:18,Yes. Did you just reset the modem? The modem appears to have reset itself.
2017-10-25 19:02:54,It’s better - up to about 46 mbps. Still nowhere near 75 mbps though.
2017-10-25 19:00:33,Thanks. Would the Shaw Cable signal have cut out when I unplugged the modem?
2017-10-25 18:58:21,Just unplugged for about 45 seconds & plugged back in. Let’s see what happens.
2017-10-25 18:56:57,Thank you!
2017-10-25 18:54:42,I will try in a bit. I recently upgraded from internet 30 to internet 75. Maybe something wasn’t changed over correctly?
2017-10-25 18:52:55,"Just tested a wired connection. Slightly faster, but not by much. 42.32 mbps."
2017-10-25 18:46:32,@Shawhelp I’m currently paying for 75 mbps of internet service. Why am I getting less than 30? pic.twitter.com/f5hEuaoUbm
2017-10-25 18:26:38,It worked. Sorry I bothered you!
2017-10-25 18:24:47,Turned off the modem. It’s coming back now. Give me a minute. I’ll let you know if it worked!
2017-10-25 18:22:16,@Shawhelp I had internet and cable hooked up today and it appears that my WiFi isn’t working. Please help.
2017-10-25 18:21:02,@Shawhelp internet is down in West St Paul MB...just north of Wpg. Any known issues?
2017-10-25 18:10:04,No TV. No internet. No phone. Great job @ShawInfo . If I wanted to call 911 this would be an issue. Good thing I have a cell. Can't get any work done either. Pineridge. #yyc @Shawhelp

2017-10-22 16:27:07,@Shawhelp Help..for the last 2 weeks A&E has had the sound cutting in and out. It only happens in 1 tv and that channel only. (1/2)
2017-10-22 16:12:54,Thanks @Shawhelp for helping. Because I’m an idiot who didn’t know you had to turn the cable box back on after a power cut #idiotatlarge
2017-10-22 16:00:26,I got out of their contact by telling them that they haven't provided the service promised so they shouldn't hold me to a contract
2017-10-22 15:08:04,I got this bullshit contract with @TELUS but ill be back for next football season for sure!
2017-10-22 15:04:00,@DAZNSucks anything from @telus ?
2017-10-22 15:00:58,@DAZN_CA your service continues to be a trainwreck when will @TELUS get it together and bring @NFL #sunday ticket or i go back to @Shawhelp
2017-10-22 14:25:12,@Shawhelp I heard NFL Sunday Ticket is back. What's the process for Blu Sky customers?
2017-10-22 14:19:47,Well then Shaw has had a lot of free advertising today. I found out that you guys were offering it from this site last week.
2017-10-22 14:17:31,"No, you can actually watch Redzone on Buffstream. Clear as day and no tech issues. I sent my complaint to the NFL to ditch DAZN"
2017-10-22 14:14:37,Look at the recent comments on this site. You have a Vancouver prospect
2017-10-22 14:10:52,It’s like shooting fish in a barrel to get people on this site. I switched last week. Now get Redzone. Here’s how DAZN treats customers pic.twitter.com/VTI6f7vw5C

2017-10-19 21:22:08,Hey Shaw. Do you know what channel the Hip documentary will be on? I've read it is going to be on CTV. Can't find it and want to PVR.
2017-10-19 21:18:37,https:// soundcloud.com/scottfreebass/ eminem-2017-bet-cypher-remixproduced-by-scott-freebass?utm_source=soundcloud&utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=twitter …
2017-10-19 21:06:45,Just an FYI to any @Shawhelp customers wanting to PVR @thehipdotcom tomorrow! Please RT everyone! pic.twitter.com/LFRQsk6OCI
2017-10-19 21:05:39,Good stuff. Thanks DH!
2017-10-19 21:03:17,So we tried to book @Shawhelp moving service and no contact from them. Wonder when they’ll actually move us?
2017-10-19 21:00:00,Did Telus ever get back to you? I bet @Shawhelp would've been able to assist quicker
2017-10-19 20:58:25,"@Shawhelp to record the @thehipdotcom doc tomorrow, are you changing what is in the guide? Or keeping it so I have to record multiple slots?"
2017-10-19 20:52:38,@shawhelp @VaughnPalmer Now cable4 in #CampbellRiver is showing sealions and playing music - did Rich Coleman back out of appearing on VoBC?
2017-10-19 20:35:34,@CTV_Television @Shawhelp will the guide be updated to be able to pvr?
2017-10-19 20:33:10,SHAW JUST DECIDED TO PLAY #NYKVSOKC WITH 2 MINUTES LEFT OF GAME. THANK YOU @Shawhelp
2017-10-19 20:24:13,@Shawhelp is there some reason Voice of B.C. isn't showing in #CampbellRiver ? Did someone forget to throw a switch? @VaughnPalmer
2017-10-19 19:59:43,I sent a DM.
2017-10-19 19:44:57,@Shawhelp I can't watch the game through my Free range app. Just the color bars and tone
2017-10-19 19:42:23,@Shawhelp the internet has been painfully slow on Bowen Island for about a week. Any chance there’s something that can be done? Have Shaw 60 pic.twitter.com/elMaj7qAE9
2017-10-19 19:35:27,I pay enough to Shaw
2017-10-19 19:22:59,Switching to #FlippingOut :D
2017-10-19 19:21:14,I don’t have that channel.
2017-10-19 19:17:48,Not PVR Ty :) DH
2017-10-19 19:17:19,"DH, thank you. I did as U said, commercials match exactly mouthes to sound, th show remains so it's not Shaw's issue. It's the show @AETV"
2017-10-19 19:16:06,@Shawhelp why is Calgary Flames game blocked in Calgary?
2017-10-19 19:14:35,Okay thanks!!!
2017-10-19 19:13:39,"It's only for that channel though, do you think that will help ?"
2017-10-19 19:06:28,"@AETV #TheEleven Waited fr this, watching via #Shaw @Shawhelp Channel 31 & the voices of people in video don't match mouths moving"
2017-10-19 18:45:04,"So if I “record this airing” from in that photo, will it record it on Friday? Or do I have to tune in & manually record?"
2017-10-19 18:44:55,The game is on TSN4 but I only get TSN3 as it’s my local TSN channel in Saskatchewan. The point of getting TSN3 was to avoid this issue.
2017-10-19 18:42:08,So we should get it in Sask???
2017-10-19 18:40:27,@CTV_Television @Shawhelp WHY DOESNT SASKATCHEWAN GET @thehipdotcom SHOW????????? pic.twitter.com/OOR1ZfnfbM

2017-10-19 17:46:02,Hey @ShawInfo @Shawhelp I live in Ontario. I get ur headquarters r out west but @Senators game should not be blacked out on Freerangetv 4 me
2017-10-19 17:35:45,@Shawhelp you should probably update ctv to say the tragically hip movie will be in so people can PVR it
2017-10-19 17:24:59,That is annoying @Shawhelp
2017-10-19 17:01:29,@Shawhelp what channel is the canucks game
2017-10-19 16:53:16,"It doesn't show up in @Shawhelp 's guide. Hope it gets updated. I see Blue Bloods, Shark Tank & In humans right now for that time period"

2017-10-19 11:55:56,Apparently Shaw's only solution to me getting Internet is for me to stand outside my neighbours house all day waiting for them to come home. Because I have all the time in the world for that. @Shawhelp
2017-10-19 11:46:31,"Actually, I'm tired of ""we're working on it."" Want to know it's happening soon or I'm leaving @Telus for @Shawhelp ."

2017-10-19 10:02:49,Thank you !
2017-10-19 09:47:26,It was on TSN 2 which is Sasktel channel 415 which is part of the standard sports package. Shaw was 226 HD. Do you have that?
2017-10-19 09:46:30,"According to the TV listings, it was on Shaw channel 226 HD and 147 non HD. Not sure if those come standard or need to be signed up for?"
2017-10-19 09:45:36,Ahh ok current network has fiber backbone but coax to the resident. Thanks for the info!! Hopefully we can have fibre right to the home soon
2017-10-19 09:36:09,Hey I’m curious if shaw will offer residential fibre soon or if there is any plan in place for that? #ineedmorefibre #shawisthebest #shaw
2017-10-19 09:32:48,"@Shawhelp What time & what channel will ‘Long Time Running ‘ air on CTV Friday October 20th.Not on guide , makes it very difficult to plan."

2017-10-19 07:44:59,But my friend on @SaskTel was able to see it
2017-10-19 07:43:02,TSN has regional rights only... so unless u live in Habs region or Jets region u get nothin. Sportsnet has national rights.

2017-10-18 21:51:45,@TSN_Sports @Shawhelp Why is a #LAKings and #Canadiens game blocked on TSN2 in BC? Time to cancel channels? #stupid

2017-10-18 21:16:29,"If the MAC is added, and the watch attempts to connect to the known network (cause the iPhone does), then the network should allow it."
2017-10-18 21:14:54,"If I’ve added the MAC manually, that’s the authentication step. So why force a second authentication?"
2017-10-18 21:13:09,Answer my question. What’s the point of adding it manually? When you log on you can just save it then. Adding it manually is a useless step.
2017-10-18 21:01:02,Thanks @Shawhelp for the #NBA league pass again this year ! This is my favourite shaw benefit ! #shawtv #NBALeaguePass

2017-10-18 20:45:45,Ok thanks for looking into it. I’ll check again tomorrow and Friday morning. Don’t want to miss it.
2017-10-18 20:41:45,Question guys. Storm means I don't go home tonight. Is there any way I can tell my Blue Sky PVR to record Nova tonight?
2017-10-18 20:40:10,@Shawhelp i keep getting the error message XRE-030506 on shaw sports channels.

2017-10-13 21:58:17,"Wow is @Shawhelp ever poorly named. Well, meaning, friendly sure...but helpful? Not very much."

2017-10-13 21:53:14,Free Range TV is Outstanding we watch it every where at anytime
2017-10-13 21:50:00,@Shawhelp We're getting frustrated that shows keep freezing and we miss key parts. Both live and on pvr. Oh and our wifi is shoddy too.
2017-10-13 21:31:35,@Shawhelp help stop your company from putting ad banners on my screen while I'M WATCHING MY SHOW!! that's not what I pay for. #shawcable

2017-10-13 19:21:35,Whoa @Shawhelp why is Ch 326 not in HD?
2017-10-13 18:59:38,How is it that Shaw can write me back within minutes of my post but I can’t get anything from @TELUSsupport
2017-10-13 18:56:24,@TELUSsupport @TELUS May lose my business here soon if they don’t offer Sunday ticket. I’ll go back to @Shawhelp

2017-10-13 16:33:37,Does your satellite carry NFL ticket?
2017-10-13 16:27:43,It's all good we @NFL fans are passionate. Rep was polite but misinformed. Thanks @ShawInfo for taking a lead on this and your response
2017-10-13 16:16:39,"Hey @Telus are you going to provide Sunday ticket or redzone? @Rogers and @Shawhelp have Sunday ticket, please get a deal done"
2017-10-13 16:12:23,Thx 4 info. @Shawhelp what incentives are there for an NFL fan wishing to switch from a provider not offering Sunday Ticket to one who does?
2017-10-13 16:06:39,"Yeah getting tired of the runaround. I have sports and time shift, what I don't have is what their competition does have."
2017-10-13 16:03:59,I totally agree. This is the answer i just got 2mins ago pic.twitter.com/ZGOhoRZFAT
2017-10-13 16:01:28,So @Telus are you planning getting #NFLSundayTicket back...or do we all have to cancel and head over to @Shawhelp ... @DAZNSucks worked hard
2017-10-13 16:00:39,We Want an answer one way or the other. Need to make arrangements with @Shawhelp if @TELUSsupport does not have Sunday ticket. Time is short
2017-10-13 15:52:17,From @TELUS We're aware of the interest in NFL Sunday Ticket and are currently investigating the option to supply it once again. Stay tuned!
2017-10-13 15:48:31,Can I get Shaw in Regina?

2017-10-13 12:29:26,I’m right with you. Looking like @Shawhelp will be gaining a few customers.
2017-10-13 12:25:23,"I've had Telus fibre for 2 years. Never going back. I have a dedicated line to my house, no sharing a backbone with my neighbours."

2017-10-12 18:50:07,@Shawhelp company. Even setting up the move and schedule a technician to come in took 4 plus phone calls due to screw ups on your end.

2017-10-10 20:27:44,@Shawhelp Fun trick you have going with the help line just be a loop and never talking to a rep. but I had a question...
2017-10-10 20:24:57,So do I blame @Sportsnet or @Shawhelp for not being able to watch the @Canucks game?

2017-10-10 00:49:21,Anyone else having issues with Shaw internet at the moment? @Shawhelp #yeg

2017-10-09 22:55:54,Arris DCX3510-M dvr box needs better LED dimming options. Can it be added in a firmware update? @Shawhelp 25% too bright; 5% too dark.
2017-10-09 22:39:41,Just sent you a DM…
2017-10-09 22:31:51,The internet dropouts happened a couple of times tonight; the four lights on the modem stayed on.
2017-10-09 21:43:36,Ok cool thx for your help
2017-10-09 21:38:37,Thanks yah I was talking about tomorrow... 302 clearly states PPV. Is that an error? Thx
2017-10-09 21:34:48,It's a d-link. I tried unplugging it and plugging it back in as well.
2017-10-09 21:28:39,Both
2017-10-09 21:24:50,Seemed to help a little but still getting super low numbers on the Shaw speed test website
2017-10-09 21:13:19,"Top 4 are solid, 5th is blinking"
2017-10-09 21:07:26,Anyone else in Sardis with @Shawhelp and have no internet service?
2017-10-09 20:34:26,@Shawhelp hi! I don't see the Canucks game on TV except for PPV? 302? What gives?
2017-10-09 19:36:17,Hope so. I’ve sent a message
2017-10-09 19:34:26,Maybe @Shawhelp can shed some light on why this is happening...
2017-10-09 19:31:29,Thanks Ken.. User error here. It's listed on 304 and 327 as well but blacked out. 350 is good. Didn't scroll up far enough!

2017-10-09 18:58:18,"Thanks Ken, would you happen to know what channel that might be?"
2017-10-09 18:53:57,@Shawhelp Is the #Flames game available on Shaw Cable tonight? I can't seem to find it.

2017-10-09 18:09:20,@Shawhelp You guys suck...so sick and tired of how terrible my shaw is for 270.00 a month
2017-10-09 17:58:46,"I haven't checked the modem when the dropouts occur (usu. about a minute in duration), but I'll be sure to look when it does."
2017-10-09 17:55:16,@Shawhelp Is it possible for you to check my internet connection? There have been dropouts in connectivity the last couple of weeks.
2017-10-09 17:50:02,"Thanks, just unplugged and plugged in. Working now"
2017-10-09 17:39:28,@Shawhelp is there any tech problems right now? My tv box is out here in Greater Toronto Area

2017-10-09 12:15:24,"That was quick, they fixed it over DMs. Thanks @Shawhelp ! Will try and stream again tonight!"

2017-10-08 22:06:10,"Okay…. Well, I’ve set up the series recording again, and will see what happens."
2017-10-08 22:00:26,"I can delete the series, sure. Not sure about ‘ensuring it chooses the HD feed’ part. Ch 271 is the HD channel for Space."
2017-10-08 21:56:23,"And it only seems to happen on scheduled recordings. If I do a manual record, it seems to work fine."
2017-10-08 21:54:09,Seems to have happened every week that show has been on. All the other recordings on other channels have been fine.
2017-10-08 21:47:47,The only series recording I currently have active on Space is Star Trek Discovery.
2017-10-08 21:47:40,Nada

2017-10-08 21:42:33,@Shawhelp Any idea why my gateway box messes up recording Space like this? Smaller picture within a box. It’s only Ch 271 (V2X postcode) pic.twitter.com/fLl5hUQibZ
2017-10-08 21:40:18,Done just waiting for the lights to all come back on.
2017-10-08 21:36:26,Like I’m trying to log into 192.168.0.1 and get an unreachable address error.
2017-10-08 21:33:33,Sure ummm been awhile how?
2017-10-08 21:31:40,Not just wireless - my gaming laptop in the basement is actually hardwired.
2017-10-08 21:31:19,Hard wire also down
2017-10-08 21:31:12,Was fine up until about half an hour ago

2017-10-08 16:45:51,$129 for the season. No Red Zone. Monthly payment plan not available. I couldn't throw my money at them fast enough.
2017-10-08 16:39:52,@Shawhelp - Last year we could watch Madam Secretary on your demand function. Very annoying to find we can’t do this anymore.....grrr
2017-10-08 16:02:48,Is it pro-rated or still $200 for the season. Not offering it from day 1 is 1 of the dumbest things I've ever seen!
2017-10-08 15:53:53,Pmed
2017-10-08 15:50:08,Entire day wasted. #shouldneverhaveswitched #telusisbetter ?
2017-10-08 15:49:29,@Shawhelp are you getting back NFL Sunday ticket?
2017-10-08 15:48:30,Thanks @Shawhelp for nothing. Made the call to switch from Telus. Guy shows up with nothing for cable. Tells us he will be back by 3 it’s 4!
2017-10-08 15:13:06,@Shawhelp Hey Shaw! Where can I go to replace my TV remote in Calgary?
2017-10-08 15:02:22,Thank you so much for your help May. Have a Happy Thanksgiving
2017-10-08 15:02:17,"21, 23 are fine (no 22) as are 56, 57."

2017-10-08 12:29:20,"True.. but Redzone is what really matters for Fantasy Football, Sunday ticket is a bit of a waste"
2017-10-08 12:14:55,Yes sir! $129 for the season. But no redzone.
2017-10-08 12:11:29,Correct. Not RedZone though
2017-10-08 12:11:02,That is correct
2017-10-08 12:09:39,Did I hear right? Shaw is offering NFL Sunday Ticket again? @Shawhelp
2017-10-08 12:02:10,"Hey, hopefully @Shawhelp can be of more assistance to you! Thanks"
2017-10-08 11:44:28,Fair. Well I'll wait till Friday/Saturday and hopefully there's a solution by then. If not I might be downgrading haha. Thanks.
2017-10-08 11:41:47,Will try unplug
2017-10-08 11:41:37,Yes all channels and all pvr recordings
2017-10-08 11:40:35,It's like a cruel taunt. Now. I'm stuck using the awful DAZN app for another week
2017-10-08 11:40:12,I get that. But seems strange that everyone but blue sky customers can get it. Lol. Especially since I can see the channels on my guide.
2017-10-08 11:35:01,Next weekend? Ouch. Hopefully it's ready by next Sunday. Starting to regret getting blue sky if that's the case...
2017-10-08 11:35:00,@Shawhelp just got new box and now the channels live/ pvr temp freeze then jumps ahead to where it currently is.
2017-10-08 11:34:09,Probably looked something like this pic.twitter.com/qPBguqHJRo
2017-10-08 11:32:23,@Shawhelp hey guys are we able to get nfl Sunday ticket yet for Blue sky customers?
2017-10-08 11:31:45,"@Shawhelp added Treehouse for my 5 yr old. Was told it was HD, it’s not. Why no HD? The ‘other’ company has it in HD..."
2017-10-08 10:38:58,"I understand why you want to go DM. But, I would like to let those also know whom follow me that you have fixed this issue."
2017-10-08 10:31:02,This needs attention. Can't tether from@phines all day. Shouldn't have touched this if there wasn't a solution. Very frustrating.
2017-10-08 10:30:10,Did that. The modem goes to switch and then to house. Still not working. Need this fixed ASAP. We all are tethering from phones. $$$$

2017-10-07 11:40:32,@ShawInfo @Shawhelp Good lord 35-35 minute hold time 109 in queue. When will you admit new modems are buggy garbage.

2017-10-07 11:30:07,No Redzone?
2017-10-07 11:10:23,@Shawhelp updates when blue sky customers can get Sunday ticket?
2017-10-07 11:10:14,@Shawhelp just actually called up was told blue sky can't add it on right now but regular customers can. Will there be a place to follow
2017-10-07 11:08:16,@Shawhelp You're now getting Sunday ticket. Info?? How much if you already have DAZN?
2017-10-07 10:21:16,"@DAZN_CA SO HAPPY @Shawhelp came through for us Canadians. Yes, no @RedZoneChannel BUT there'll also be a solid feed and no lag."
2017-10-07 10:16:24,@Shawhelp it seems like a larger issue than just me when a sampling of friends have CC #gibberish on higher channels #gatewayfail
2017-10-07 10:13:36,Bell?

2017-10-07 09:46:21,Just called @Shawhelp in BC and they knew nothing.......is this some sort of trick? Please elaborate.
2017-10-07 09:45:22,Make the move to @Shawhelp boys for football season.

2017-10-07 09:30:07,Do I also have to pay @Shawhelp for it or does what I payed for you cover it?

2017-10-06 20:29:17,No they are not. This is Canada.
2017-10-06 20:28:44,Only on MLB because Sportsnet chose not to purchase.
2017-10-06 20:27:39,When did this happen? Is the @nflnetwork finally in HD? @Shawhelp
2017-10-06 20:25:40,It really is. The Astros game yesterday was the same deal. Only on MLB.
2017-10-06 20:24:59,Why? Games are always televised. Annoying AF
2017-10-06 20:24:46,Thanks. It wasn't just me though. Lots of other people involved.
2017-10-06 20:24:32,FreeRange TV has saved me allot of Pain like on hot days watching TV on the Balcony or at Starbucks etc even soaking in the Tub chilling
2017-10-06 20:22:17,You did the heavy lifting though. Thank you so much for taking the lead on this!
2017-10-06 20:21:51,"I mean it, man. This is in large part solely because of your efforts. You ran a relentless, respectful campaign."
2017-10-06 20:19:35,It’s only on MLB network.

2017-10-06 20:15:14,I guess Sportsnet was to cheap to buy the rights to the game from MLB.
2017-10-06 20:12:54,Don't they have like 5 TSN channels?

2017-10-06 20:01:23,@Shawhelp understand its early but how do DAZN customers dump that Sunday Ticket in favor of getting it added to our cable package instead?
2017-10-06 19:53:52,"Yankees and Indians tied in the 12th. Sounds super boring, glad I can't watch. Thanks @Shawhelp and @MLBNetwork for making sure I don't."

2017-10-06 16:12:09,Guys I have played your channel request game before (NFL in HD) and it took 4 years ... its a scam; is Rogers holding you hostage?
2017-10-06 16:05:17,@Shawhelp MLB Network? Why are you not carrying this channel? Is this another NFL Network in HD situation?
2017-10-06 15:42:05,Thanks! Will do. And thanks for answering your phones. I'll take customer service over a few extra mbs of internet speed ANY DAY of the WEEK

2017-10-04 09:26:46,give me a moment I'll have to ask about it
2017-10-04 09:17:50,"oh thought i wrote that in first reply, fully wired connection. Sorry lol"
2017-10-04 09:15:28,google speed test gives me a 10mbps down speed but sites using Ookla tell me I have 110-170mbps down
2017-10-04 09:13:42,"Problems are still persisting after 2 router restarts, games start off around 60RTT but jump up after 30 seconds to 200RTT"
2017-10-04 09:09:35,It came back on this morning at 630AM. 6 hours later.
2017-10-04 08:58:29,"reset pc, nothing. Reset router and testing now. Tried 3 speedtest sites and all have different results. Will tweet back if errors persist"
2017-10-04 08:39:17,"@Shawhelp I have shaw open 150, since yesterday it's been dropping down to 10mbps on a whim, can't play anything without a 200 RTT. Pls help"

2017-10-01 17:30:56,@Shawhelp your wifi in Kitsilano is horrible. You can send a guy out to fix it tomorrow or good bye.

2017-10-01 14:54:39,@TELUSsupport worst service I have ever used. Had to use Twitter and still no way of reaching you. I'll be switching back to @Shawhelp asap
2017-10-01 14:50:55,"Harvey, you have helped me out in the past, I wanna say March. You're a good man and a great help. You should go work for MTS or something."
2017-10-01 14:32:00,My next call to cancel our service will be much shorter. Don't get much free time these days but @Shawhelp has found a great way to ruin it.
2017-10-01 14:30:19,"Just to be clear, Shaw TV wasn't working (AGAIN), and they suggest an easier way to pay them. A 35 min wait on phone, 20 min wait online."

2017-09-30 19:42:03,@NHLJets fans who are @Shawhelp customers in Winnipeg: Is the game tonight not televised?
2017-09-30 19:40:17,@Shawhelp hi Shaw! What channel does the show Heartbeat usually play on in Western Canada?
2017-09-30 19:36:21,It has nothing to do with a blackout. TSN didn't set it up properly.
2017-09-30 19:35:56,We need more options in Canada. We keep allowing monopolies and piss poor service. @TELUSsupport and @Shawhelp are both junk.

2017-09-30 16:29:30,Your rep advised @Shawhelp only staffs for new hooks ups. Existing custs are shit; last priority and have to wait 6days for an appt.
2017-09-30 16:17:25,So does that mean it won't be offered for free again?
2017-09-30 16:12:07,Ok but there was also a lot of places listed there from you guys. Maintenance stuff from across western Canada.

2017-09-26 17:21:13,At least Telus is a public company and have actual shareholders to report to. Shaw answers ONLY to the Shaw family.
2017-09-26 17:18:03,id burn babies alive before i do anything with Telus they fucked me over so hard when i first got to canada
2017-09-26 17:14:06,"I'm at the point where I'm seriously considering switching to @TELUSsupport , because they can offer me similar service at half the cost."
2017-09-26 17:13:00,"And yes, I've gone through restarting everything, I also use a wired connection."
2017-09-26 17:12:45,"My connection routinely drops out daily, multiple times a day, and it's happening at hardware points OUTSIDE of my residence."
2017-09-26 17:12:10,"I've had issues with latency for ages, and the cheapness continues by routing me through crappy Shaw gateways that can't handle the load."
2017-09-26 17:11:26,A better Tier 1 provider would NOT route traffic through 3 major exchanges that add incredible unnecessary latency.
2017-09-26 17:11:26,"I am a big fan of pumpkin spice lattes, why you ask ? Cause we make the best with fresh ingredients only @WickedCup Check us out"

2017-09-25 19:05:54,. @Shawhelp My cable box just reset itself while I was watching TV. It was recording at the time. Was this a system wide reset?
2017-09-25 19:04:06,"@Shawhelp why is Monday Night Football not on TV tonight? #NFL#MNF says ""live starting at 10pm. The game is on now!! Why can't I watch it?"

2017-09-25 17:28:10,@Shawhelp is there a reason TSN is down? Hoping to watch FOOTBALL tonight
2017-09-25 17:25:16,Stupid question...can I watch a show that I have PVR'd while I am PVRing another show? I have Blue Sky...love it...

2017-09-25 16:47:01,"@Shawhelp does it cost anything to watch Netflix on tv, besides the account and whatnot, like any data or something?"

2017-09-22 10:24:18,How can Shaw cancel your Telus? If they did that I'd lose it too....don't see how that is legal. Accept nothing less than a free year.

2017-09-20 18:56:46,351 is blacked out. I am in #Calgary . I watched @NHLJets & @mnwild on Monday night. What changed?
2017-09-20 18:41:41,"I did the online chat and AMY was wonderful, everything is restored now!"
2017-09-20 18:38:42,@Shawhelp @FoodNetworkCA oye so this weeks Guys Superstar eppy 4 is actually eppy 3. guys whats going on? labelled 4? but really 3? lame!
2017-09-20 18:33:30,"@Shawhelp . So... @EdmontonOilers / @NHLJets game is blacked out, in #Calgary , but the game is not on any other channels? Channel 351."
2017-09-20 18:31:33,"But shouldn't the game be available through centre ice, which is the ppv channels?"
2017-09-20 18:22:54,Thank you!
2017-09-20 18:22:51,"No, it's not that. The website stream should work from Edmonton Oilers just fine, if not use the youtube link I sent ya."
2017-09-20 18:22:18,https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=dGoC7p YhjZQ … or use this
2017-09-20 18:22:12,Maybe it's because I'm not a Rogers customer?
2017-09-20 18:21:03,Open it it in Chrome?
2017-09-20 18:20:45,The stream isn't working for me! !
2017-09-20 18:19:50,Not your fault. Thanks for letting me know
2017-09-20 18:18:23,least the stream works!
2017-09-20 18:17:01,"Yeah I double checked, Oilers tweeted out that todays game and the Saturday one should have had the blackout lifted..."
2017-09-20 18:16:28,"Yeah I'm getting the ""Blackout"" on Centre Ice too. Sigh"
2017-09-20 18:15:22,Center Ice is supposed to prevent these =\
2017-09-20 18:15:06,"Its because TSN Jets coverage is local to Manitoba only. But I saw the team say it was on Center Ice, but it says it's blackout restricted"
2017-09-20 18:14:32,"Not for me. For some reason I get TSN 1, 2, 4, & 5. But TSN 3 ""The scheduled program is not available in your region""."
2017-09-20 18:13:36,"Center Ice Channel does show the game, and doesn't give the no subscription thing, but oh well no worries, I found a stream."
2017-09-20 18:12:40,"No I'm in Edmonton, TSN Jets local coverage is blacked out, gotta use Center Ice. Honestly I'm just assuming the free preview for CI is on"
2017-09-20 18:12:39,"When you live in Edmonton, pay an extra $200 for Center Ice and STILL can't get the Oilers game wtf @Shawhelp"
2017-09-20 18:12:33,I am in Edmonton. 183 says blacked out and 238 is not a channel I get. 351 says blacked out too
2017-09-20 18:11:39,"Nope it says blacked out too, only showing in Winnipeg region lol."
2017-09-20 18:11:05,It wont be on tv lol.
2017-09-20 18:10:36,This is fkn brutal. It's a preseason. There is no reason for it to be blacked out. @EdmontonOilers @Shawhelp @NHL
2017-09-20 18:09:41,FIX IT please pretty please
2017-09-20 18:05:43,@Shawhelp The Oilers Jets game was supposed to be on Center ice according to the Oilers but is showing blacked out...?

2017-09-19 14:25:29,"That's great to hear. Is there a limit? 1 has broken buttons and frustrating to use. 2nd one is less broken, so lower priority to replace."
2017-09-19 14:18:24,I've heard in past that if you brought in your broken pvr remote Shaw would replace for free. Still true or do I have to buy replacement?

2017-09-17 18:24:36,"Hi, my internet restored the morning after - but when streaming on twitch my connection seems very unstable. drops to 0kbps every ~10mins"
2017-09-17 17:51:56,"Hi, almost 6 pm here in Calgary and No Content coming up on all channels. Emmy's in 10 min! What's up?"
2017-09-17 17:28:31,I know :( your service last year was just so much better and of much higher quality. Hoping it's back next season!
2017-09-17 17:03:38,Getting ahold of @Shawhelp on the phone is insane. I wish the tv and internet would work correctly #annoyed
2017-09-17 17:03:01,We switched to @telus 6 months ago and there is NO comparison. Good switch
2017-09-17 16:52:48,As mentioned already we tried that. It made things worse. Time stuck at midnight. Can't scroll or change channels in guide now.
2017-09-17 16:51:26,@Shawhelp . Fix your cable listings! Haven't been working all week. Resetting made it worse. Can't scroll/change channels when in guide now.
2017-09-17 16:47:41,Same issue here for us and it's been over a week. Powering off/resetting made it worse.
2017-09-17 16:33:33,"It's most frustrating when Canadian channels carry same games as US. IE, 49ers on 203 and 210 right now. That's a waste of a channel."
2017-09-17 16:26:07,At one point Rams were on both channels....
2017-09-17 16:19:22,"@Shawhelp Why does the TV guide say ""Cowboys vs Broncos"" on 217, the game I WANT to watch, but it's showing ""Rams vs Redskins""???"
2017-09-17 16:13:35,"@Shawhelp i DMed you guys, can you check it?"
2017-09-17 16:08:13,And we're back on-line. Thanks guys! :)
2017-09-17 15:41:20,Thank you
2017-09-17 15:37:10,"It's all good now, thanks!"
2017-09-17 15:36:50,What channel will the hockey package be airing @Shawhelp
2017-09-17 15:34:48,Better let @ShawInfo know!
2017-09-17 15:33:12,"Thanks, I did that, but it's still down. Fingers crossed it will reconnect shortly. #inthequeue :)"
2017-09-17 15:28:04,"Ah but Lance, you field the angry, upset, frustrated (feel free to fill in blanks) customers who just want their service.. and you shine. :)"
2017-09-17 15:26:20,"Yikes, try unplugging the modem, and plugging it back in again. Ours booted up about 8 minutes ago after I did this."
2017-09-17 15:24:33,"We've got TV, didn't check the phone, but wifi - the most important - is still out."
2017-09-17 15:21:49,Will do - thanks again! Hope the rest of your Sunday is quiet :-)
2017-09-17 15:19:04,The game is on SN360
2017-09-17 15:18:13,@Shawhelp @Sportsnet has 3 channels supposedly carrying @Canucks game but all 3 instead showing bitter boring end of another BlueJays loss https:// twitter.com/Pokeyloo/statu s/909523307522695168 …

2017-09-17 09:15:02,It says the maintenance was supposed to be over 9 MDT. Is this gonna be fixed before 10AM PST? I need to watch football.
2017-09-17 09:12:27,Any ideas on how to get the channels back on your listings. Tried everything to reprogram?
2017-09-17 09:09:01,@Shawhelp any reports of issues logging into Shaw from TSN's live streams?

2017-09-16 23:25:01,just sat down to watch tv as kids are asleep and no demand available?? how about 3am on a Wednesday instead?
2017-09-16 23:09:24,"Wow! Fantastic timing for a scheduled maintenance to VOD! I pay $100's/mo. Why no heads up?! Shame on you, @ShawInfo @Shawhelp !"
2017-09-16 23:06:26,@Shawhelp Here's the thing. If you're going to compete with Netflix one needs to be able to actually sign into the app.

2017-09-13 20:36:57,If customers don't see in the apps hit the button on the Remote and Say Netflix and it will appear for them
2017-09-13 20:34:37,"@Shawhelp older box, has not been unplugged or turned off recently and suddenly half the channels say ""to be announced"" why?"
2017-09-13 20:31:37,They're coming to our house tomorrow.
2017-09-13 20:24:26,I'd replace the coax cable. Use a good quality RG6. Perhaps you can exchange at Shaw office?
2017-09-13 20:23:50,"hah! no, everything is fine. he was helping me with new services, and was a great rep. thank you very much!"
2017-09-13 20:20:03,"#Netflix and #ShawBlueSky now offered on one device, refer to @Shawhelp for more info"

2017-09-13 20:15:05,"Yup, at all connections (box, wall). Maybe a bit better - will keep an eye on things."
2017-09-13 20:15:02,"If resetting the coax cable doesn't help, then replacing it is next step. After that, further up the line or a bad gateway"
2017-09-13 20:13:27,"Depending on the frequency, some channels will be affected more than others. (Something I noticed when Westman was unencrypted years ago)"

2017-09-13 20:03:47,"Hmm... I'm noticing some channels are better than others, soooo....."
2017-09-13 20:02:29,That's a signal problem. Either a problem with the gateway or the coax heading to it. (Or at shaw's headend)

2017-09-09 16:14:32,It's annoying but at least you have your active fans who come to ur channel every day to see if you posted.
2017-09-09 16:14:23,The notifications work for me!
2017-09-09 16:14:15,I know
2017-09-09 16:13:18,remember when you used to dm me all the time lol
2017-09-09 16:12:52,Shaw should let me leave without paying my contract out. My notifs haven't worked for almost a month @Shawhelp
2017-09-09 16:11:59,Maybe
2017-09-09 16:11:41,I think it's like your internet. I don't think it's your fault. You didn't do anything

2017-09-09 08:24:46,Your a Fine Man
2017-09-09 08:24:02,I'd be on the phone or going to their office and giving them a piece of my mind. Would also bring proof since they're morons.

2017-09-08 22:51:44,nope just first one solid second blinking
2017-09-08 22:49:10,@Shawhelp internet down in prince Albert sk?
2017-09-08 21:26:27,Directly to the wall.
2017-09-08 21:22:10,Second & third from the bottom and second from the top are blinking.
2017-09-08 21:18:31,"@Shawhelp is internet down in Lethbridge, AB?"
2017-09-08 19:56:54,Thanks for your help Ken
2017-09-08 19:52:31,And it definitely wasn't me who broke it
2017-09-08 19:52:23,"This is my second gateway, and it looks like it might have been a refurbished one honestly. The ""warranty void if broken"" sticker is broken"
2017-09-08 19:51:05,"Only splitter is the 1 the installer put in to split b/w gateway and portal. I have a different portal and tried it, have same issues."
2017-09-08 19:45:13,So this is just funny now. The channels that weren't working before do now. But the ones that did work before now don't between 200-219
2017-09-08 19:40:36,"@ShawInfo @Shawhelp terrible that my installation gets cancelled last second, when I cancelled my families Friday night plans to be home"
2017-09-08 19:34:26,"Ken, thanks for the inquiry. We're currently with you guys, just trying to see what my best deal out there is."
2017-09-08 19:25:49,"Also a number of SD channels appear to have the same issue, some working some not."
2017-09-08 19:25:27,"Didn't work. 201, 203, 205, 207, 209, 211, 214, 218, 220, 261 all show Signal Loss Detected error. TSN 238 is now intermittently working"
2017-09-08 19:10:37,I was sent a link with all the cable channels but packs like Large Movies has 3 subsections. So isthat 1 theme pack or 3?
2017-09-08 19:08:48,Yes Im in Surrey BC. I was offered a deal if I seitched 2 Shaw of 7 themes plus basic cable. Not sure what constitutes a theme pack.
2017-09-08 19:07:12,I did try last night but not today. I didn't want to try anything else and lose the football game last night! I'll try again now.
2017-09-08 19:06:19,When I channel up past NBC the channel #skips back to NBC but shows what is on Fox. Then I hit channel up again and it puts Fox w correct #
2017-09-08 19:04:23,"NBC and CBC are giving the same error today. Last night NBC worked, TSN didn't, and I don't know about CBC. I only have one tv."
2017-09-08 19:02:58,@Shawhelp Hi. Can U tell me re Shaw TV bundles: Is the Large Ent 2 theme pack considered 1 option or 3 separate bundle when getting TV 7 pks
2017-09-08 18:58:44,@Shawhelp is there a reason that TSN hasn't worked on my tv the last two days? Signal loss detected. Most channels work by a few don't.
2017-09-08 18:51:10,"I'm going to be your worst nightmare when this is all over,let the anti-shaw rants begin,I have already turned away lots of new customers."
2017-09-08 18:49:39,"Now I just found out you guys replaced my top generation Gateway with shitty gateways,thanks to your honest service rep,your scam artists."
2017-09-08 18:24:50,Mines like 2.0 lol ima need to upgrade
2017-09-08 18:18:43,"Ok nvm this is strange dude, you're getting scammed"
2017-09-08 18:17:57,"That's actually normal, it can't use all internetspeed on that one process. I got 500mb/s and it downloads at like 40mb/s :P"

2017-09-08 08:36:52,Lol you realize I am Donut deprived
2017-09-08 08:34:47,It's not that the hotspots don't work. It's just the continual attempting to connect and then losing the connection when I've walked past
2017-09-08 08:34:05,Yes. If I stay in one spot I'll connect. It seems like by the time my phone connects I've walked past the hotspot

2017-09-07 20:16:53,Then when you complain they use the only defence and that is read your user agreement
2017-09-07 20:15:54,Telus maybe be cheaper at the beginning and they Promise the Sun and Deliver Nothing

2017-09-07 19:37:30,@Shawhelp September 12th Netflix will integrate with bluskyTV

2017-09-07 19:10:31,Just after I sent that tweet it was all good again. Thanks
2017-09-07 19:09:44,Sorry my wife accidentally unplugged the router...
2017-09-07 19:08:06,Mine in Prince Albert just went down as well
2017-09-07 19:06:59,@Shawhelp are there connection problems in Winnipeg?
2017-09-07 18:54:58,"I've been watching Haystack TV on Roku, and had several @Shawhelp commercials raise the decibel level through the roof. I now HATE SHAW"
2017-09-07 18:26:48,@Shawhelp I noticed that the Shaw-Go-Wifi is really slow. I had to turn off my wifi to end my parking session. I was in the beltline.
2017-09-07 18:16:07,Is there a list of everything I should have when bringing back devices like this?
2017-09-07 17:59:31,"Thanks for responding, if you can provide feedback upstream, it is laughable that you're marketing a servive that you can't provide specs on"
2017-09-07 17:51:40,@Shawhelp If I'm going to connect a wireless router to my modem do I need to change any settings in it?
2017-09-07 17:49:43,It says 80+ channels. So someone made a list and counted at some point.
2017-09-07 17:48:57,So when I'm shopping for cable tv packages there is no way to know of which channels will be available on the go? Ads suggest it's not all
2017-09-07 17:42:29,@Shawhelp I'm looking to find a list that shows what cable tv channels are also available on #freerangetv
2017-09-07 17:42:24,@Shawhelp any network issues atm? My receiver has rebooted on it's own twice in last 10 min
2017-09-07 17:40:14,@Shawhelp where in wpg do I return my cable box and phone box if I am cancelling services?
2017-09-07 17:12:12,@Shawhelp I just wanted to let you guys know I'm very happy with my service. The person I dealt with on the phone last week was great.

2017-09-01 22:14:44,Yes. But Wi-Fi also cuffs out art mangy other times. Perhaps when other users on network are ding something.

2017-09-01 21:09:38,"internet intermittent over the past week. Can you fix it? Varsity, Calgary."
2017-09-01 21:03:10,@Shawhelp Y'all are damned lucky that the program your sh** dropped is coming on again next week.
2017-09-01 20:59:25,"No time to elaborate, @Shawhelp , but this ""new & improved"" PVR y'all sent me, dropped ANOTHER set recording. What the hell?"
2017-09-01 20:53:37,Thanks for the quick reply!
2017-09-01 20:49:10,"@Shawhelp Is there an outage in Langley right now? 200 St & 70 Ave, specifically. All my services are down."
2017-09-01 20:36:53,@Shawhelp is this true?
2017-09-01 20:22:00,@Shawhelp what gives? Did you really turn this down?
2017-09-01 19:51:05,Time for @TELUS

2017-09-01 19:35:01,. @bchydro @TELUS @Shawhelp Old pole left for telco to re/re cabling. Pole hit by car. Top X brace severely damaged. Safety issue. Vancouver pic.twitter.com/xJFUvpzFO2
2017-09-01 19:03:43,Even with MS active exchange?
2017-09-01 18:33:47,Maybe @Shawhelp will listen to a guy with 750 thousand followers. Your viewers ( myself included ) are not happy. I miss the trucks.
2017-09-01 18:17:18,Calling @Shawhelp to get options on cancelling due to poor service. On hold almost an hour. Proving my point ?
2017-09-01 18:06:22,You guys have always been there for me when I needed assistance.
2017-09-01 18:04:41,"HUGE improvement, thanks. Everyone needs to try this if they have a problem before blaming the ISP."
2017-09-01 18:00:46,"Phoned @ShawInfo @Shawhelp tonight and it's a 35-45 minute wait. I was 438th in the cue, thankfully they have a call back service!"
2017-09-01 17:59:28,"My wifi was working less than brilliantly. Tried changing the channel, and the difference was night and day. Wow! @ShawHelp"
2017-09-01 17:24:33,"Thank you! I saw a Shaw truck come by... not sure if they were here for our issue, or to help hookup new neighbours? Any update on that?"

2017-09-01 16:34:30,"@Shawhelp I can sign in on my browser but I downloaded the app and using the exact same info, I cannot sign in. What should I do?"
2017-09-01 15:25:26,"@Shawhelp custy on Westcoast here , thx for not listening to your customers! @Rogers when will u offer TVservice here? #bcracejunkie"
2017-09-01 15:10:19,Extremely disappointed with @TELUS service representative 3 phone calls later missed booking broken promise and lack follow up @Shawhelp

2017-09-01 14:26:04,The Shaw chat just told me there is an extensive outage in my area.
2017-09-01 14:22:19,@Shawhelp I've been on hold for almost 40 mins! Would be nice to know how much longer I'll have to wait?
2017-09-01 14:18:02,"Hi @Shawhelp , Any news on what is causing the internet outage in Richmond, BC and when it will be back up and working?"
2017-09-01 14:13:11,I'm trying it at home
2017-09-01 14:11:22,I'm not getting any channels on it at the moment. Can I DM you my info so you can reboot it now?
2017-09-01 14:04:21,"Boooo! But on another note, your wifi name is too cute"
2017-09-01 14:02:26,"Why, Shaw, why? Every. Single. Day. Can't even connect to wifi in my own home. Switching to telus @ShawInfo @Shawhelp #comefixit pic.twitter.com/jdPd2HrFWZ"
2017-09-01 13:58:59,"Will it need a ""reboot"" after being in the closet for quite some time?"
2017-09-01 13:54:53,Thanks. I wanna make sure it works before selling it to a friend.
2017-09-01 13:51:34,@Shawhelp Will a DCT6416 work within a Gateway loop?

2017-09-01 12:57:07,It's a persistent issue that I've had for years.

2017-09-01 12:42:00,Super helpful thanks so much!!!!!!

2017-09-01 12:25:55,Can dooo
2017-09-01 12:25:33,"It's also a brand new router, so explain to me what sending a tech will do? You have terrible service."
2017-09-01 12:22:24,Yo @Shawhelp looking @doing some changes to tv and inet but can't find what was in the sports1 and family package from way back
2017-09-01 12:21:45,I'm sitting here staring at the lights on my router and watching them go out. Then back on. Then out. So tell me again it's interference.
2017-09-01 12:19:54,"But surely you'll look into it, it's only been happening for two years."
2017-09-01 12:19:09,"Oh and we currently have a huge credit on our account, so I'm literally overpaying you guys to not have my service."
2017-09-01 12:18:32,"Not to mention we actually pay to BOOST our wifi package every bloody month to keep this from happening. Turns out, that's useless."
2017-09-01 12:17:45,"Also annoying because we've been going over our data last two months, because our wifi is always so inconsistent."
2017-09-01 12:16:09,@Shawhelp really difficult to run a home business when Wi-Fi cuts in and out very 5 min. Are you limiting my bandwidth?
2017-09-01 11:38:16,@Shawhelp had a great install guy very helpful polite and extremely nice!!! I am so a happy camper now with TV and Internet!
2017-09-01 11:35:24,@TELUS I sign a 2 year agreement and my install date get switched 3 times. @Shawhelp now I am a Shaw customer will never recommend Telus!!!

2017-09-01 10:53:12,...but it looks like she might've ended it before we had a chance to arrange to move the email to our shaw account.
2017-09-01 10:52:35,"Heya. My Ma closed down her Shaw service, including her email, and she's moved. Our plan was to add her email to our shaw account."
2017-09-01 10:51:39,@Shawhelp hey there my internet isn't working can you help
2017-09-01 10:46:29,"Would be nice to have an option to leave a call back, or when should I try again?"
2017-09-01 10:45:55,@Shawhelp hiya. Anyone up and ready to help the desperate?
2017-09-01 10:37:47,"@Shawhelp , 40 minutes #onhold , is it because I selected the option to #cancel my services? #yyc #poorcustomerservice"
2017-09-01 09:44:27,"@Shawhelp Good morning, is anything not working in the west Edmonton area? I've been unable to pull a DHCP address all morning."

2017-08-31 21:16:50,"@Shawhelp requested call back 2 hours ago, supposed 2 b within 30-45mins, never received one. I called back & have been on hold for 30mins"
2017-08-31 21:03:02,If only the other hundred thousand people didn't use it at the same time then it's be fast. Oh well. Sacrifices must be made
2017-08-31 20:58:44,"@Shawhelp psstttt hey guys, thanks for the free WiFi @PNE_Playland . No data overage fees for this guy!"
2017-08-31 20:14:41,"Thank you. And, the internet connection is so slow! We were told it would be a lot faster. It is noticeably slower... not noticeably fast"
2017-08-31 19:44:10,It worked the other day yes... but this is a daily occurrence since upgrading our service. Is this to be expected now?
2017-08-31 19:33:07,"Yep but shouldn't have to.-doesn't address the fundamental issue-happens daily at the same time. Doing nothing, will work in 15 minutes."
2017-08-31 19:27:45,Done that. I shouldn't have to do this daily! Which has been the case since we upgraded... not impressed. Thought the bugs had been sorted
2017-08-31 19:19:38,at least 50 people here wish you could too. Please credit my account for the time I've spent here @$50/hour. Thanks.

2017-08-30 19:18:27,We used 2 separate emails but it never came to either one. And we used the one that receives the e-bill.
2017-08-30 19:13:46,Just trying to log in. We requested both the username and password (at different times) as we were confused why it wasn't accepting it
2017-08-30 19:02:46,"I guess if u could train your call centre not to be robot, would be a good start"
2017-08-30 19:00:44,U first first fix your home services before u get mobile!

2017-08-30 18:23:02,"Okay, thanks"
2017-08-30 18:18:39,I would like a lower bill. $150/mo is a bit excessive when I was paying $119 in June. Lol
2017-08-30 18:18:17,Good. How can one check their package? Does shaw offer package deals? We're giving serious thought to going to a competitor
2017-08-30 18:09:05,Okay. Checked this out https://www. shaw.ca/television/new s-and-free-previews/ … and assumed they were going
2017-08-30 18:04:55,"In the surrey are of BC, so Food Network and HGTV"

2017-08-30 17:55:47,On the phone with Fraser. He's looking into it. Thanks though
2017-08-30 17:51:41,There's fashionably late and there's this guy. Actually if you could ask the SHAW Corp to act with an iota of integrity that would be super.
2017-08-30 17:48:20,@Shawhelp hi. Any global issues around Barlow Trail? Our internet at Executive Royal Hotel has slowed to a crawl
2017-08-30 17:47:31,"That was my mistake I was looking at 272, thanks for clearing that up"

2017-08-30 16:39:57,"Yes, except last weekend PBS (non HD) recordings and non recordings were pretty much unwatchable. I have seen pixelation, but rarely."
2017-08-30 16:24:01,I have this problem as well. Called them yesterday and was on hold for 30mins before I gave up. And that was after a callback.
2017-08-30 16:01:09,It's still not back. What happened?
2017-08-30 15:54:57,"@Shawhelp When I play back program recorded in HD, sound stops and starts intermittently. PVR is Motorola DCT3416 I. Do I need a new one??"

2017-08-30 15:26:48,"@Shawhelp if I have a negative balance, can I just leave it?"
2017-08-30 15:23:29,@Shawhelp could you dm me
2017-08-30 14:43:11,"In other words, you should have ZERO customers with CRT televisions and BlueSky."
2017-08-30 14:41:34,"ok. I don't buy that at all. But also, BlueSky boxes are all Digital/HD output. So what market are you trying to placate with SD output?"
2017-08-30 14:36:18,so you have NO PLANS to upgrade SD channels? Ever?
2017-08-30 14:32:17,Love how my bill seems to slowly creeps higher every other month because of price increases in service. @Shawhelp pic.twitter.com/oM7fbiq8Zi
2017-08-30 14:30:23,@Shawhelp when are the BlueSky channels going to be all in HD? It's pretty weird that in 2017 you are broadcasting so many SD channels.
2017-08-30 14:26:28,"Aaand just like that, Internet order submitted. Thanks for your quick responses!"
2017-08-30 14:02:37,Thanks Phil! Looking online now at your internet options.

2017-08-30 12:45:00,@ShawInfo @Shawhelp it is nearly impossible to get help at your Southgate Centre location. Not enough staff. Many frustrated customers.
2017-08-30 12:41:54,Harvey at @Shawhelp @ShawInfo not reimbursing #YYC customer for not meeting their contact obligations. They would cease service #shoe #foot

2017-08-29 21:13:38,@Shawhelp Just checked your tweets from the fight night and there are tons of tweets about glitching.. Why am i being lied to and hung up on

2017-08-28 06:36:10,@Shawhelp our cable is out
2017-08-28 00:30:20,Email address which only required the name before the @. A Shaw ID would require an entire email address. Is the Shaw I'd becoming mandatory
2017-08-28 00:26:11,I started to create one but it said that would deactivate the main Shaw login so I did not activate. I usually authenticate with a Shaw 1/2
2017-08-27 23:07:52,"then the flash thing pops up, i have the latest flash and added it. so im at a lose 2/2"
2017-08-27 23:07:03,"I have done that, and every time I click on free range it says ""now connecting to your entertainment experience"" 1/2"

2017-08-27 23:04:55,"In the 4 years I've been with you guys, I've had a tech come out every 4-5 months to ""fix"" stuff when all that happens is swapping coax."

2017-08-27 23:00:57,"It's not my house or location, I've been assured that many times. It's your mediocre equipment and poor tech resolution."
2017-08-27 22:59:55,And every time I call into tech support it's always something that requires a tech to come out.
2017-08-27 22:59:17,I used to work for a satellite TV/Internet installation company so everything you've said I've done more than enough times.

2017-08-27 11:55:27,haven't been on another channel yet lol seems ok now but as I mentioned it kinda comes and goes
2017-08-27 11:48:26,"@Shawhelp any audio issues on Spike? (ch 43) it's continuously skipping, comes and goes"
2017-08-27 11:44:16,"@Shawhelp intermittent internet in North surrey near river rd and 117 street. download at 55 up at .08 Mbps, this has been for a day..."
2017-08-27 11:36:40,"Ok, I will try that next. Been so excited that I haven't had to since bridging I thought that was perfect now"
2017-08-27 11:36:39,Not one to usually complain but was ridiculous and very frustrating to have happen with 30+ people at our home for planned event.
2017-08-27 11:35:13,"Considering the circumstances we want our TV/Internet fixed (coming Tues), ensure refund of fight, get compensation as it ruined party."
2017-08-27 11:30:04,"Yes, the Shaw router/modem is bridged going to my Google wifi. Since you guys bridged it, it has been rock solid 100%."
2017-08-27 11:17:58,"Only rebooted router first. After that, I figured maybe area problem? I'm in Chilliwack."
2017-08-27 11:16:41,Hey @Shawhelp any student tv promos happening?
2017-08-27 11:07:31,Any ideas why my uploads speed are way down today? @Shawhelp pic.twitter.com/iwI4C9HY9G

2017-08-27 01:40:08,@Shawhelp Authenticating with Shaw on Tsngo orSpacego only seems to work with main account login but can't paste pswd. How do you use email? pic.twitter.com/Xdvlqwqfi5

2017-08-26 23:59:27,@Shawhelp internet in Airdrie down?
2017-08-26 23:46:24,"Thanks! I must already have it if it's showing up, unless it's on preview. If not, at least it's an option now."
2017-08-26 23:26:06,"Thanks, but changing the channel back and forth did the trick."
2017-08-26 23:19:46,"After investigation, this is likely a @TELUS or @Shawhelp utility box and must be attended to by the appropriate utility."
2017-08-26 23:16:49,All fixed!
2017-08-26 23:13:57,Well @Bell @Bell_Support took their add down for football so who knows what's happening now?

2017-08-26 22:02:45,@Shawhelp your feed better hold up or i want my money back. Last fight kept cutting out and I'm not unplugging and resetting my whole setup
2017-08-26 22:02:44,"@Shawhelp hey the mayweather vs mcgregor fight is constantly cutting out and blurry image, do I get a refund?"

2017-08-26 21:35:26,Yes - do not bill me for product i didnt receive.
2017-08-26 21:33:34,"It's all good now, I power cycled the modem a couple times and that worked."
2017-08-26 21:26:08,It ended up working 5 minutes after I said something. Thanks though!
2017-08-26 21:25:15,@Shawhelp how do I see the fight? I can't find it on Shaw on demand
2017-08-26 21:24:14,WTF @Shawhelp ??? Why is the payperview that I'm paying $100 for glitching out???
2017-08-26 21:22:11,Just DM you
2017-08-26 21:16:55,Is it because we are in a specific area
2017-08-26 21:16:24,We already tried that and didn't work yet!
2017-08-26 21:15:56,Thank you fixed!
2017-08-26 21:12:20,Sent
2017-08-26 21:10:45,It basically says the federal right and rules about watching the game. But we already purchased it
2017-08-26 21:09:27,Me too. Was on hold for hour & gave up.Go 2 friends or bar 2watch fight. Apparently Shaw will 'look at' your account when u get billed
2017-08-26 21:07:44,Yup twice
2017-08-26 21:07:28,We actually finally got through on the phone and it's fixed now. Thanks!
2017-08-26 21:06:30,@Shawhelp 2 hours later and I finally get to watch the fight. $100 well spent......
2017-08-26 21:03:44,Thanks we unplugged and reset both the main gateway and the portal and that worked.
2017-08-26 20:59:23,All good - thanks for the follow up!
2017-08-26 20:56:41,@Shawhelp why isn't the fight working between mayweather&mccgregor in Winnipeg?!
2017-08-26 20:55:00,When we try to tune to 300 it pops up the menu with the 'watch' option but clicking that just takes us to a black screen.
2017-08-26 20:52:06,Figured it out. The purchase didn't go through on your end apparently according to the phone support person. Thanks.
2017-08-26 20:50:34,@Shawhelp please help me !! I've ordered the PPV and still have no signal almost 2 hours in !!!!
2017-08-26 20:47:09,Thanks - but I'm pretty sure the issue is with @UFC .
2017-08-26 20:46:58,"038-0530-2431. We were recording it, I wonder if that had anything to do with it."
2017-08-26 20:46:31,I mimic all the frustration of this current thread. Sad day for fight fans.
2017-08-26 20:45:07,"Switched to MTS, all good thanks anyway"
2017-08-26 20:44:05,Reset the gateway and the Portals. Nothing.
2017-08-26 20:44:04,"Had twitter support from Richard, up and running now. Lost an hour."
2017-08-26 20:39:06,Waiting for an hour and a half to get through and the fight still isn't on the tv due to technical difficulty... ANSWER THE PHONE PLEASE!!
2017-08-26 20:38:07,You'll look it over? I will not pay.
2017-08-26 20:38:06,"Brutal. Not sure if you're streaming, but http:// ufc.tv is basically down for everyone I think"
2017-08-26 20:35:50,Anybody else's ppv commentary in french
2017-08-26 20:35:27,Yes - had trouble with PPV order. @shaw reset the gateway (?) & we now have the fight. Took us 1.5 hours from initial prob. to resolution.
2017-08-26 20:35:10,"@Shawhelp Accidentally bought fight in SD, wanted HD- possible to fix?"
2017-08-26 20:31:13,Were you having trouble streaming the fight by chance? @ufc is basically down for me
2017-08-26 20:30:52,Did that a long time ago. Everyone here to watch left to watch at neighbourhood pub. I trust we wont be billed now that its 8:30??
2017-08-26 20:26:07,@Shawhelp waiting for 1hr 10 mins to order fight!! McGregor vs Mayweather.... Shaw Direct satellite... Can you please order for us!!??

2017-08-26 20:25:31,Thank you...tried the troubleshooting techniques and I now have the fight 45 minutes later though
2017-08-26 20:24:30,"Thank you, @shawhelp , your @Twitter assistance was faster than your phone line and your website chat line. Appreciate the help!"
2017-08-26 20:23:46,Me too. Not working well
2017-08-26 20:21:43,"@Shawhelp We've reset, unplugged, ordered three times and we still can't get the fight. This is ridiculous."

2017-08-26 19:57:21,@Shawhelp I presume we will not be charged for the PPV fight we ordered & cant watch? Where is the support st $99/ purchase?
2017-08-26 19:57:19,@Shawhelp hey - can't seem to purchase the fight? Tried unplugging it the box. No go. Help!
2017-08-26 19:56:42,Maybe god is telling you the jets are not worth watching

2017-08-26 17:16:07,"No offense, but that's just stupid. It should be a feature that is unlocked w/ the subscription. (You can have that idea. Now run w/ it. )"
2017-08-26 16:43:50,"Speaking of which, how come my @WWENetwork doesn't have the OnDemand option? Shaw jipped me of the free mon. Gonna jip me of OnDemand, too?"

2017-08-26 16:39:49,Not the end of the world. Just sucks that it's not included in the On Demand.
2017-08-26 16:39:36,@Shawhelp my Shaw box froze up randomly and now just says no IP. I've rebooted four or five times now. What else can I do?
2017-08-26 15:46:07,Not sure you want it right now
2017-08-26 15:40:24,Not going to pay money to support a racist and a woman-beater fighting for $130 million. Overpaid wastes of skin.
2017-08-26 15:36:20,@Shawhelp hi! Can I cancel my service by going to a Shaw Kiosk (say Oakridge mall)?

2017-08-26 15:23:23,Gets my downvote!
2017-08-26 15:09:23,"@Shawhelp However, the ""new"" (refurbished) PVR has already omitted one of my programmed recordings. Does all of your equipment suck?!"
2017-08-26 15:08:18,"@Shawhelp I got the new (refurbished) PVR y'all sent me. Like it, though it's taking some getting used to."

2017-08-25 22:42:09,@Shawhelp I was messaging with you last night and now have another issues - can I just send another DM? Thanks
2017-08-25 22:34:39,@Shawhelp Is there an internet outage for the Bridgeland/ Renfrew area in Calgary?

2017-08-25 21:08:04,I want to thank @Shawhelp for their assistance in getting my BFF's cable sorted out. She is very happy to have her favourite channels back.
2017-08-25 21:03:53,Thanks for the reply. Apple TV it is then! Thanks!
2017-08-25 20:53:01,@Shawhelp looking for some help ordering the fight for tomorrow night. We have internet with you but not TV. Still possible?
2017-08-25 20:03:16,Lost service too. Must be an outage?
2017-08-25 20:00:32,@Shawhelp hey there! Our tv and internet just stopped working in wood buffalo neighbourhood in Fort mcmurray - planned outage?
2017-08-25 19:42:12,Yes and it sounds like they just believe that I gave my password to my modem to someone. Going dm... ok
2017-08-25 19:39:51,I have talked to them. I just want to know if it's possible that they have made a mistake.
2017-08-25 19:38:52,Is it possible there system has made a mistake. Because I live alone & it's impossible. Even watching movies 24 hours would only be 72 GB
2017-08-25 19:37:25,Its a telus acct but I may soon part company with them if I can't resolve it.
2017-08-25 19:36:11,@Shawhelp I am sick to my stomach. When I checked usage today shows more than 300 gb used in one day. Its impossible. 1/2
2017-08-25 19:19:00,I will give this a try
2017-08-25 19:17:57,It does seem to be hd channels.

2017-08-25 14:37:50,@Shawhelp hey guys. Curious if you've received my payment yet? I posted it late Wednesday from OLB.
2017-08-25 14:03:51,Do you know who is? It seems impossible to find any good details on this event for Canada. @ufc @Bell @Shawhelp
2017-08-25 13:57:44,thank you :) frustration might be forcing our hand in the fall!
2017-08-25 13:43:00,"Honestly, this is not very good customer service."
2017-08-25 13:39:33,Can you tell them to hurry up at answer my phone call? It is almost an hour now.
2017-08-25 13:30:03,"@Shawhelp It is coming up on 50 minutes now, this is ridiculous."
2017-08-25 13:16:52,It is almost 35 minutes now
2017-08-25 13:16:49,@Shawhelp my phone support agent was amazing. I didn't get her name. If I DM deets can you ck my file and send commendation to her manager?
2017-08-25 13:08:29,"@Shawhelp I have been on hold for over 25 minutes now, are that many people really trying to cancel your services right now?"
2017-08-25 12:15:46,recorded call with Stephanie at @Shawhelp where i gave new credit card. without my permission stephanie switched my bill type. why?
2017-08-25 12:09:47,"Could also just skip this, use your phones browser to go switch to @TELUSsupport LOL."
2017-08-25 11:07:31,"Thank you for letting me know, hopefully it is up and running soon."
2017-08-25 10:53:28,"@Shawhelp do you have any outages reported for Calgary, all of the sudden the modem cannot get online."
2017-08-25 10:40:25,"Trust me, if you guys had service in the area you would have tons of clients. I've already spoken with Business services about it. Thanks."

2017-08-25 09:40:12,"Thankfully since the box talks, it'll announce if descriptive video available and I'll just selected for each time I want to watch it."
2017-08-25 09:32:26,Will that do any good if my city is in the heat of the outage map?
2017-08-25 09:24:04,@Shawhelp you guys are bullshit we don't pay you hundreds for wifi that only works sometimes fix that shit fr
2017-08-25 09:20:58,"Correct, but it shouldn't turn off recorded commentary of a sports event"
2017-08-25 09:15:58,"Would get the Odd commercial audio, then game no commentary. Thought golf channel was down."
2017-08-25 09:13:56,I thought the golf channel wasn't working. I was getting descriptive video on other channels
2017-08-25 09:12:46,That wouldn't work as I couldn't read it anyways
2017-08-25 09:08:07,Ug this sucks. Tryong to turn on video description but it turns sap on causing commentary to go away on the golf channel @Shawhelp
2017-08-25 08:44:43,Done :). Thank you
2017-08-25 08:40:05,Did that last night. Was working this morning and went out again at 6:45. I've left home now. Will try resetting again tonight.

2017-08-23 16:48:41,@Shawhelp Is there an ETA on when services in downtown Winnipeg will be restored?
2017-08-23 16:26:23,Seriously @Shawhelp put in for a callback on receiver issue (after 10-15 minute initial wait) callback comes only to be put on HOLD! #yeg

2017-08-22 18:39:33,It seemed a hard reset fixed it. Annoying that we have to do that each time. Hard for kids to do that by themselves. Frustrating.

2017-08-21 08:01:04,@Shawhelp can you let me know if I'm supposed to call you after I install my new modem? Thanks
2017-08-21 07:22:10,"Its almost as tho Wi-Fi isnt a service that can be guaranteed because of all the variables that can happen..oh, wait thats the case exactly"
2017-08-21 02:56:56,"Ironically, my parents LOVE the persistence of Telus. They said Shaw made them feel unvalued."
2017-08-21 01:49:19,"@Shawhelp I just got one of your newer modems and now my Xbox one NAT type is nothing but strict, how can I change this."
2017-08-21 00:53:58,@Shawhelp when is new #GameOfThrones episodes available on #freerangetv

2017-08-21 00:27:43,You are pathetic @ShawInfo . Absolutely no help from @Shawhelp . Worst service ever. Fix your shit and stop wasting my time. #Useless .

2017-08-20 22:45:11,@Shawhelp @ShawInfo what's with all the artifacting on tonight's @hbo shows??
2017-08-20 22:45:03,"I've been following the updates on the outage in Aldergrove, for a fair amount of time it says it's been resolved but it's still down."
2017-08-20 22:10:45,"Will do, thank you !!"

2017-08-20 21:25:17,Thanks! I'll let them know.
2017-08-20 21:23:01,"@shawhelp My parents are happy their cable is back, but they still have no internet. Flushed DNS, but still not working Advice? #Aldergrove"
2017-08-20 21:08:51,We have a technician coming the 1st I'm just shocked that this happens everyday day and I keep getting told that my internet is fine pic.twitter.com/3WPIBfqjad
2017-08-20 20:57:20,"I had problems with Telus years ago too, so hard to get an English speaking customer service rep. Shaw tells you what center you call."
2017-08-20 20:48:26,It's just internet traffic that is routing properly.
2017-08-20 20:48:09,Not possible. Would require a whole lot of network changes to get things connected. I use passthrough local traffic is running properly
2017-08-20 20:44:52,How did you know what address in referring to? And yes 2 ip. Run 2 networks
2017-08-20 20:41:07,Speedtest shows 560kbps should be around 150mbps
2017-08-20 20:40:44,Nope. Tried wifi on 3 bands and hardwire
2017-08-20 20:37:59,@Shawhelp hey guys. Internet problem in Sherwood park? Speed is painfully slow. Unusable. Have restarted everything

2017-08-20 19:57:24,it says no IP and the little blue light. i tried to unplug and plug back in but nothing. no internet either :( just the modem for net.
2017-08-20 19:56:50,thanks! yeah no phone TV or net all day so far. its such a helpless feeling! just glad we haven't needed 911 *knocks on wood*
2017-08-20 19:55:56,I would be devastated. I actually feel your pain.
2017-08-20 19:53:31,unless @Shawhelp gets my internet back up in 7 mins I'm not able to watch season 4 of my fave summer show live! #thelastship ugh! https:// twitter.com/SpaceChannel/s tatus/899330421439254528 …

2017-08-20 19:14:03,Thank you!
2017-08-20 18:55:53,@Shawhelp is there a problem in sime parts of Chilliwack?
2017-08-20 18:45:25,"Telecoms are an example of economic oligopoly, and they know themselves well."
2017-08-20 18:42:44,"Your post reads like this to telecom, 'clients want to subsidize our network improvements.'"
2017-08-20 18:28:45,Any update on an approximate restoration time?? *Hopefully before Game of Thrones airs* lol
2017-08-20 18:22:58,It was probably a decade for me as well. But I've never had an iota of the internet problems with Shaw that I had with Telus.
2017-08-20 18:07:51,Telus has no shame when it comes to trying to get customers. They also have no interest in keeping a customer.
2017-08-20 17:58:36,"I used Telus a decade ago, so I'm not sure how reliable it is right now. But this kind of business practices should be stopped."
2017-08-20 17:53:10,"@Shawhelp my router doesn't seem to be putting out my 5G network, what could be the issue?"
2017-08-20 17:47:58,I'm okay with paying more for a more reliable product.
2017-08-20 17:06:20,Still no internet and tv in Aldergrove. Will you post it as soon as it's back online? Thanks.
2017-08-20 16:03:09,"Most persistent salespeople ever, they just *won't* leave. Very unprofessional of Telus."
2017-08-20 15:40:48,. @TELUS Could you stop sending people to tell residents that @Shawhelp customers are overpaying for their internet? Just stop.
2017-08-20 14:45:18,A day....no way you can justify billing me as much as you do. I need a break on my bill because the services are just so bad all the time...
2017-08-20 14:44:32,Constantly having troubles my wifi is done for the 4th day in a row and the only way to fix it is to call in and be on hold for 10 mins
2017-08-20 14:31:11,It never works anywhere
2017-08-20 14:24:06,@Shawhelp Your Shaw Open sucks. It never works. All it does is disrupt my internet service! FIX IT
2017-08-20 14:12:22,What does DM mean? Sorry not great with twitter.
2017-08-20 14:09:42,@Shawhelp is there an ETA on the Aldergrove outage? It's been like 6hrs
2017-08-20 13:44:14,@Shawhelp we are having a tough time contacting shaw help via phone. Can you add voice mail back to my Moms home phone?
2017-08-20 13:20:10,"Much appreciated! I'd buy you tim Hortons if I could, have a good day!"
2017-08-20 13:09:19,Shaws request line is a sham.. you guys give HD options for crap like Hifi and Love Nature.. but not NFL. What's your retention number?
2017-08-20 12:52:18,You services are brutal...absolutely brutal. More like Shaw 150kbps
2017-08-20 12:50:38,This internet is brutal and I'm sick of calling every 2 days to get everything working. This is brutal Shaw. Absolutely brutal...
2017-08-20 12:42:58,Actually I live in Aldergrove as well and my internet isn't working ever since I woke up today. This isn't normal. Hopefully it's back soon?
2017-08-20 12:37:39,@Shawhelp do you have any cable packages available where one can purchase the mcgregor/mayweather fight?
2017-08-20 12:36:52,@Shawhelp why can't I watch a NFL preseason games in HD? On top of losing Redzone.. we can't even get HD options for preseason..
2017-08-20 12:27:28,"I'm hoping we'll hear a ""stayed tuned"" soon."
2017-08-20 12:26:28,"@Shawhelp I hope there's a plan for airing as many NFL games as possible, I will never switch to some streaming service. RedZone was great."
2017-08-20 11:58:02,@Shawhelp any outages in Mckenzie lake right now?
2017-08-20 11:52:23,Probably all these 1080P and 4K screens in the house with Surround Sound etc and Analog just doesn't cut it at all

2017-08-19 13:03:28,@Shawhelp is @TELUS right that even though I pay 4 Shaw150 I'm still sharing it w/ others? Would explain why internet cuts out consistently

2017-08-18 22:18:09,@Shawhelp I guess I set the PVR for the midnight repeat. Hopefully that stays on and I get to see the 1st half of the show now missed.
2017-08-18 22:14:30,"Shouldn’t blame HBO, @Shawhelp seems to have a hard time keeping signals on the air."
2017-08-18 22:11:43,"@Shawhelp Wow, 2 minutes into Live Realtime with Bill Maher, you lose the signal? I hate to say it, but this is why I cancelled HBO before."
2017-08-18 22:11:13,"@Shawhelp We have lost Internet, too. South side Edmonton."
2017-08-18 22:05:55,I got a response via direct message. Said to simply not watch & order will nullify itself but made note on acct to void 2. Thnks @Shawhelp !
2017-08-18 21:57:27,"Eh @Shawhelp Jus turned to put on de Karate Kid. Description beez 1984 ones, but to me disgust, it actually beez de latest. Fix dis asap!"

2017-08-18 20:29:38,@Shawhelp will you guys offer all NFL games through timeshift via Shaw Direct? I know Bell & Telus are offering it.
2017-08-18 20:12:01,Thanks for standing by!

2017-08-18 18:26:37,@Shawhelp you guys need to figure out what coverage you will have for NFL. I'm on the verge of switching to Bell if I don't get answers soon
2017-08-18 18:03:00,Ours isn't working in either.

2017-08-18 17:20:32,People might start flocking over there it's a pretty big deal for nfl fans
2017-08-18 17:20:01,Thanks I don't know who makes these calls but Shaw should be talking to Bell about getting more since they claim to be showing all NFL games
2017-08-18 17:18:05,Do you know when you'll find out? Season starts in three weeks.
2017-08-18 17:15:45,"@Shawhelp @ShawInfo Quick question, are you gaining access to more CTV channels on your guide for the football season?"
2017-08-18 17:14:54,@Shawhelp Bell is offering EVERY NFL game on Sunday through their timeshift package. Will you guys be doing the same?
2017-08-18 17:14:50,I was. I'm with Telus now.
2017-08-18 17:12:40,You get NFL Network in HD? You're obviously not with @Shawhelp
2017-08-18 16:12:12,Done

2017-08-18 10:08:08,Thanks! I am now in and really like the new app
2017-08-18 09:52:18,I didn't know you can't get Bell TV in BC? They never mentioned that when I was on the phone with them yesterday.
2017-08-18 09:50:04,I'm stuck too. At least I can stream it on my mobile devices. I have a 4 screen tv setup that's totally messed though.
2017-08-18 09:48:04,@Shawhelp Hi! I am trying to recover a password so I can get into the new app but I didn't get the email to reset it. Ugh
2017-08-18 09:47:07,hey @Shawhelp why do you make it so easy to sign up but such a pain in the ass to cancel
2017-08-18 09:15:52,How about about you just tell your techs to set things up securely to begin with.
2017-08-18 09:14:35,Anyone know of a decent 3rd party router that works well with @Shawhelp Openwide 150 modem/router? Need for gaming/streaming..
2017-08-18 09:10:35,Shaw did not even give them administrative access to this gear.
2017-08-18 09:09:52,This has happened to two of my clients because you talked them into it. They had no idea what you setup until i visited.
2017-08-18 08:26:15,And I'm over here stuck with DAZN. RIP 2017-2018 football season.
2017-08-18 08:24:59,I just got all the channel from @Bell that give me all the football games. I'm ready to go boys! Fuck @DAZN_CA
2017-08-18 08:06:26,"Yeah we don't even have the option of Bell in BC, HOPEFULLY Shaw finds a way I hate DAZN."

2017-08-18 07:40:20,So probably not very likely.
2017-08-18 07:39:57,"Colin, Bell owns CTV & TSN where the games will be shown, I imagine Shaw would have to make a deal to add extra CTV chans to their lineup."
2017-08-18 07:30:18,@Shawhelp will you be gettting this timeshifting feature to show every NFL game on tv?
2017-08-18 06:35:09,@Shawhelp waiting from Saturday for a call to fix a billing issue on a promotional offer that wasn't even installed in the first place.
2017-08-18 06:33:49,@Shawhelp ok so three months in and your service is terrible. Billing issues. Channel issues and no one willing to actually follow up.
2017-08-17 23:06:26,@Shawhelp how to get a show go wifi hot spot in my business?
2017-08-17 23:05:02,Thanks will you guys be trying to show extra games this year or is that undecided?
2017-08-17 22:58:03,"Oh well, if its just a few days then thats cool! I thot it would be weeks. That's awesome! Thanks shaw person! :)"

2017-08-17 22:41:25,@Shawhelp Hello! Suddenly I can't find Game of Thrones in the VOD HBOCanafa section. Thought I did before. Where are the series? Thanks!
2017-08-17 22:21:13,@Shawhelp Will you be timeshifting to cover all NFL games as a work around to DAZN as Bell has advertised they will be?
2017-08-17 21:45:02,"@Shawhelp are you having a problem with devices trying to connect? If I switch between routers I've got a 50/50 of ""connected no internet""."
2017-08-17 21:03:20,"Wi-Fi. Internet 75. Nothing has been tried, appletv and our phones/tabs/comp worked great last week before Shaw came here to ""upgrade"" us."
2017-08-17 20:56:36,"@shawhelp How is that after you ""upgrade"" us to 3x faster internet, it's the slowest internet I've had in years? #dialupwasfaster #nonetflix"
2017-08-17 20:24:07,"Lol well played, but after more years than we can count we are leaving @Shawhelp due to poor service and lack of appreciation. #breakingup"
2017-08-17 20:08:45,That’s ok. Tired of waiting for someone to respond.
2017-08-17 20:06:01,@Shawhelp Can someone contact me to discuss my services? I’m not interested in talking to someone who is helping others at the same time.
2017-08-17 19:46:20,Sure thing.
2017-08-17 19:44:17,Do you guys give out t-shirts or caps to streamers?
2017-08-17 19:40:32,Upgraded my current internet 150 1TB plan to the Unlimited 150 plan thanks @Shawhelp @ShawInfo time to stream Unlimited
2017-08-17 19:30:20,Wall jack
2017-08-17 19:26:08,I would Switch to Shaw Mobile in a heartbeat
2017-08-17 19:26:07,I would but Shaw on Demand is working on the Motorola now. It should work ALL THE TIME.
2017-08-17 19:20:04,If it was called Shaw Mobile everyone would switch including me
2017-08-17 19:15:18,Hi Ken! I haven't. It it would be nice if it was called Shaw Mobile
2017-08-17 19:14:21,Motorola but I don't use the other one much
2017-08-17 18:42:43,Sounds good! DM'd!
2017-08-17 18:39:02,@Shawhelp Setting up new cable box and getting no IP error. Have tried resetting and re plugging all cables
2017-08-17 18:34:24,Hey @Shawhelp .. u had Internet client have speed test issues with win 10 post creators update? Thanks.
2017-08-17 18:19:38,That's great to hear. @DAZN_CA is absolutely awful so I can't cut my cable...yet. The NFL is the only thing holding me back
2017-08-17 18:14:49,Wow. So Shaw Direct should show all games and most will be in HD. Wicked news! Why doesn't @Shawhelp provide similar service
2017-08-17 17:58:22,Hi @Shawhelp @ShawInfo When will you have shaw mobility we need better phone plans and a better phone network. #shawftw
2017-08-17 17:44:17,High speed is an advertisement moniker? High speed is a descriptive term.
2017-08-17 17:43:15,"A supervisor already ""helped"" next stop consumer affairs. False advertising."
2017-08-17 17:42:46,@Shawhelp was on the phone with a supervisor saying the name of the package has nothing to do with the speed of the internet.
2017-08-17 17:41:56,@Shawhelp that's false advertising. Calling something high speed when it's not?
2017-08-17 17:40:22,"@Shawhelp been paying this ""high speed"" thought is was computer making it slow, get new computer, find out shaw is lying about its service"
2017-08-17 17:39:42,Bell figured it out. Gonna play all nfl games using their regional CTV channels.
2017-08-17 17:39:25,@Shawhelp also won't discount to any of the new plans because discount is only for new customers. We thought we had high speed internet
2017-08-17 17:38:56,Bell will be offering all games via timeshift CTV regional channels. Hope Shaw follows suit
2017-08-17 17:38:45,When @Shawhelp bill says you're getting high speed internet & you find out max download is 7mbps and max upload is 1mbps. False advertising
2017-08-17 17:13:01,K. Huge buzz right now as ppl in Canada not happy with #dazn so this is a great plan by Bell to combat
2017-08-17 17:08:51,Same question to @Shawhelp
2017-08-17 17:08:18,@Bell now offers 15 dif regional CTV channels to enable ability to show all Sunday NFL games with the timeshift package
2017-08-17 17:07:07,@Shawhelp any plan to add more HD regional CTV feeds prior to @NFL season. @CTV_Television showing different games regionally this season.
2017-08-17 17:05:26,Bell now has 15 regional CTV channels in HD. They will show dif games in dif regions. That's how they will show all games
2017-08-17 17:04:09,Im having the same issue. This happened shortly after our power got cut
2017-08-17 16:58:25,Looks like TV is currently down too.
2017-08-17 16:56:54,@Shawhelp Is Shaw internet having issues at the moment? I've tried unplugging my router a bunch of times already and still no Internet.

2017-08-12 13:10:53,"@Shawhelp my shaw open works on my phone perfectly but on my laptop certain sites won't load. Most sites dont work besides fb,google,youtube"

2017-08-12 09:46:46,"I know that it's not your fault, Lance, but you must appreciate how perfectly this communicates Shaw's apathy towards their customers."

2017-08-11 20:42:07,@Shawhelp I've had 1-855-274-7429 call me 3 or 4 times. They never talk and just hang up when I answer. I see this is a Shaw #. What's up?

2017-08-11 20:25:34,Barely an apology from the other rep when I cancelled the upgrade. Now your reps want me to upgrade again requiring more modem shenanigans
2017-08-11 20:24:20,If I hadn't cancelled the upgrade we would have been without service and unable to work for 4-5 hours.
2017-08-11 20:23:05,CS rep shut off our service for a modem swap in the middle of the day. I was downtown with new modem while hubby was at home trying to work.
2017-08-11 18:53:59,@Shawhelp having so many issues with Shaw lately.. making me rethink a provider I've been with for years.
2017-08-11 18:46:24,I made my payment Aug 10. As per my bill. Now I am receiving bullying email. Seriously thing about dumping Shaw and switching to Telus.
2017-08-11 18:14:56,"Thanks, info has been sent!"
2017-08-11 17:35:47,@Shawhelp Shaw my bank takes 3 days to post payments. Bulling customers won't help. Talk to the banks for real-time payments. @CRTCeng
2017-08-11 16:16:46,I was with @Shawhelp for years and only switched to @TELUS to save money. But the switch wasn't worth it at all. #angrytweeting #yesimmad

2017-08-11 13:15:22,Your other Twitter rep refused to help & attempted to obtain confidential identification from me via Twitter which is unacceptable.
2017-08-11 13:14:51,I want Shaw to recognize my continued loyalty and lower my monthly internet rate. $90 is insane & I can get a better price at @Bell_MTSHelps
2017-08-11 13:12:44,I was able to talk to someone on the phone. Thanks.
2017-08-11 13:05:32,I've been on hold with @Shawhelp for 27 minutes. No offer of a callback. This is ridiculous.

2017-08-09 09:10:36,I've noticed that with our Hitron/150 setup that we get transient outages. Sometimes it's just the 2.4 radio but typically it is both.

2017-08-08 20:29:20,Will do. Appreciate the assist

2017-08-08 19:03:32,There was no option to restart. Only lock and close. Now it got locked by accident.
2017-08-08 18:50:11,@Shawhelp help please. SOD can't be rewatched.

2017-08-08 12:23:24,It was one of TMN channels. M3 I think. Definitely not the kind of movie the guide indicated it was going to be.

2017-08-05 21:01:53,I know why. It's to deceive the new customers to thinking that the regular price hasn't been bumped up 5 bucks. Nice tactic.

2017-08-01 14:47:37,You can not expect us to continue to pay for services we are not getting for 10 days without some kind of fix before then.
2017-08-01 14:46:16,@Shawhelp I find it unacceptable that we've been without service for a day but the earliest a tech can come help us is August 10th.

2017-07-29 18:41:07,"Yeah, they're fine now."
2017-07-29 18:24:27,thank you. Doing so now.
2017-07-29 18:20:22,@Shawhelp I have twice sent in emails asking for pricing info. No answer. I assume you guys don't want new business coming from a competitor
2017-07-29 18:14:01,Happens between those times past for days
2017-07-29 18:06:57,@Shawhelp Can you reset my parental controls? I need to order the fights...and forgot it

2017-07-29 15:46:02,How do i find content through SOD? I have an old remote.
2017-07-29 15:42:56,"I'm always telling people not to download. Why, I don't know. You guys are digging your own grave"
2017-07-29 15:38:17,@Shawhelp @HBOCanada Just spent 30 min trying to get Shaw to explain to me how I access streaming content. No one could explain it.
2017-07-29 14:11:19,@Shawhelp Where on VOD is the movie Dr. No? It appears to be on the VOD website but not on my tv.
2017-07-29 14:10:21,"@Shawhelp hi, we've switched to telus (sorry), and we still have your box. What do we do with it?"

2017-07-29 13:14:54,"Maybe in time. But for now I'm too mad. BTW, I currently have highest internet service you provide and 4 cable boxes."
2017-07-29 13:09:49,But you guys have no such service. And long queues for in house help. I would pay $100 an hour for this type of help.
2017-07-29 13:07:50,I'm too angry to call you guys. I have to get calm before I call you. I would happily pay for a shaw person to come help me at my home...
2017-07-29 13:06:02,"6) if shaw's direction is talking into a remote while eating food, I'm out. That's disgusting!! Imagine looking into top of remote"
2017-07-29 13:03:05,5) I enjoyed free preview of HBO Canada. Watched everything. Went to search for HBO Canada and these shows. THEY are not ANYWHERE!

2017-07-29 12:58:35,3) programming. I was loving watching real time with bill Mayer. Then about a month ago 'poof' it's gone. Why?
2017-07-29 12:54:56,Then when I came back to shaw the install guy said - 'there was a software fix for that'. At the time I had the gateway shaw could not fix.
2017-07-29 12:52:47,2) I had shaw gateway years ago. Then went to another provider because this gateway seemed to reset at the end of every hour on the hour...
2017-07-29 12:50:50,1) menu-recordings-select season/series-select an episode-select 'delete this recording'. Used to be able to delete whole series. Not now.

2017-07-28 22:46:43,Apparently our email accounts got stuck being moved from the old to new servers. Hubby realized he's had no mail since Tuesday!

2017-07-28 11:55:40,Check y'all dm
2017-07-28 11:54:56,This is why cable is dying and people resort to streaming services or downloading.
2017-07-28 11:54:12,"Not only is it consistently wrong, I get told to ""just pay it and we'll fix it next bill"" but it took 3 months to get a $30 refund."
2017-07-28 11:51:44,Nope. Done with that. I'm calling in to cancel the service you can't get right. You've had 4 months to stop messing it up. I warned you.
2017-07-28 11:50:20,Now I gotta wait weeks for something cause of what 1 person said different front the person today
2017-07-28 11:48:22,Yes how bout bring able to talk to the same ppl when u call in. I got the same problem but I get a diff answer every time I call in
2017-07-28 11:44:29,@Shawhelp - My bill is wrong for the 4th month in a row. At what point do you take accountability? I have to spend time on this every month.
2017-07-28 11:37:42,@ShawInfo @Shawhelp is really pushing me to the edge

2017-07-28 11:11:33,"Unfortunately, your chat rep that I waited 15 minutes waiting to talk to told me I can't cancel online, only via the phone line."

2017-07-19 03:34:48,I am fine and what about you
2017-07-19 01:45:20,@Shawhelp does upgrading from High Speed 25 to internet 150 include a new modem change? Also do I get the online promo?
2017-07-18 22:56:26,About the same... roughly a dozen seconds
2017-07-18 22:50:12,@KSPSpublicTV just broke into the @KCTS9 signal again ~9:49pm PDST
2017-07-18 22:23:56,Cathy VW77 from Live Chat deserves a huge shoutout for being the best super-agent there is. #morethanregular @shawhelp @shawinfo
2017-07-18 22:10:10,@ShawHelp How much time in advance should I book a moving appointment with #Shaw ?
2017-07-18 21:01:14,Until next week.
2017-07-18 20:56:04,"Happy @Shawhelp customer for 10+years. Sign 2yr BlueSky contract, service plummets. 3 one-hr tech calls in 3 wks, intermittent TV & internet"
2017-07-18 20:08:19,"I mean, honestly I rarely ever use TV, but for the few times I do it seems like it would be great!"
2017-07-18 19:53:00,Have to get back to you (tomorrow) with that model number.
2017-07-18 19:51:31,"Hello,None of the wireless modems are what my parents have. We have a Motorola cable modem that is then linked to a netgear wireless router"
2017-07-18 19:47:41,Directly to the cable box.
2017-07-18 19:44:38,"But then starting around 4pm today (Pacific time zone), @LastWeekTonight wasn't findable even with search-by-title."
2017-07-18 19:42:47,"@ShawHelp : What's wrong with ShawOnDemand? First @LastWeekTonight wasn't in SOD's TMN/ @HBOCanada area, but findable with search-by-title …"
2017-07-18 19:05:45,Ok. I'll look at this and see what I can sort out.
2017-07-18 19:01:22,No 5g listed. And even beside the modem etc it tests as slow on my phone.
2017-07-18 18:59:22,"Copy. We have two Comps , I pad and phone in use currently. I don't see the 5g on my phone."
2017-07-18 18:54:25,How would I identify if it's 5g?
2017-07-18 18:50:00,Yeah we're getting 0.3 download and o.6 upload upstairs away from the modem. Any recommendations? pic.twitter.com/g0e85cOdcY
2017-07-18 18:44:20,@Shawhelp is the internet down ... Collingwood area
2017-07-18 18:42:05,Great. I tested beside modem & download speed was greatly improved. I'll try a few things & then see what I can troubleshoot
2017-07-18 18:32:19,"@Shawhelp Having very slow internet at my parents place in Devon. They aren't that savvy with internet,is there a contact can use for them?"

2017-07-18 16:40:03,"Thanks, Dylan. I'll come calling in a couple hours if it doesn't!"
2017-07-18 16:36:59,Not yet but other things plugged into the same outlet are back up and fine.
2017-07-18 16:36:19,Now I'm realizing there's a power outage in my neighbourhood. Makes sense. Will modem just come back online by itself later?
2017-07-18 16:32:57,"@Shawhelp Help! Power seemed to cut for a second and everything came back online but the modem. Tried power cycling, no lights, no luck."
2017-07-18 15:43:32,I called the number on my bill - they said the wait would be 5-15 mins
2017-07-18 15:36:48,@Shawhelp your business solutions SUCK! Have been on hold for 38 minutes! Absurd
2017-07-18 14:53:33,@Shawhelp got shaw and my home internet sucks most of the time and shawopen/passpoint never connects????
2017-07-18 14:45:06,@Shawhelp I'm in east side Vancouver and my internet is out. What's the deal guys? Any info on when I'll be back online?
2017-07-18 14:41:49,Looks like it just came back online.
2017-07-18 14:36:41,Have reset everything. Still down.
2017-07-18 14:33:46,Last two times were confirmed issues in my area. A few of the lights out on modem today.
2017-07-18 14:17:17,@Shawhelp - Internet is down in Abbotsford for the third time in two weeks. This is getting really disruptive.
2017-07-18 13:30:25,Unfortunately shaw doesnt provide that same type of service. Wish they did.
2017-07-18 13:15:47,Good info
2017-07-18 13:02:42,Telus supplies extenders. They did a full check of my place and made sure there was good wifi signal throughout.
2017-07-18 12:54:04,Those little quick outages hurts my business. When is it going to be finished?
2017-07-18 12:53:12,@Shawhelp Hello. Any known outages for internet in the Edmonton area? Mine was working until about 20 minutes ago

2017-07-18 11:54:03,We had a tech come in. Just told us to go to best buy
2017-07-18 11:52:49,"@Shawhelp why is getting what you want from Shaw so difficult !!!! OMG ,Telus here I come"

2017-07-18 11:00:38,Lol sorry doesnt help when youre going over your cellphone data every month. It is what it is.
2017-07-18 10:56:58,Yup. Honestly every suggestion you guys have made doesnt work. Been buying different extenders but those crap out too.
2017-07-18 10:56:12,Yeah would help if they provided some sort of solution instead of dishing out $100s out of our pocket just to get some connection
2017-07-18 10:49:23,"Size, concrete, walls all that matters unfortunately not much shaw can do there"
2017-07-18 10:39:58,Whats the point of paying $100 a month for internet if you have to go buy more products to get full coverage around your house @Shawhelp
2017-07-18 10:25:30,@Shawhelp Spotty internet in Victoria/Saanich.... just me?

2017-07-16 18:24:05,Adds that block anything on TV shows are infuriating we already have commercials why do you show ads on live TV shows @Shawhelp
2017-07-16 18:20:45,@Shawhelp your ad that just took ove the screen on Big Brother just blocked some important subtitles. Thanks for ruining the show

2017-07-16 18:04:37,@Shawhelp Telus has started released Gigabit speeds in certain areas. Does Shaw plan to offer Gigabit speeds any time soon?

2017-07-16 16:34:06,Hello @Shawhelp - I added @HBO Canada yesterday but it's not showing up in my channel lineup. Help?

2017-07-16 12:02:00,@Shawhelp will you be added more Game of Throne season to SOD?
2017-07-16 11:48:54,@Shawhelp Maybe Shaw can help out. Any chance you're willing to take my money Shaw?

2017-07-15 17:28:57,Does Shaw have mobile service?
2017-07-15 17:27:24,We've been with Telus 10+ years. No complaints until we switched to fiber optic. 5 service issues the last 3 months. Patience wearing thin.
2017-07-15 17:27:03,Happily with your competition for the last 6 years..
2017-07-15 17:18:21,Telus .. Shaw raised prices on me twice in a year.. and a complete hassle to switch
2017-07-15 17:08:07,And 4k channels. Tricky to chose regardless... Oh and with the fires shaw was down. But you guys are doing a great job - my rental has shaw
2017-07-15 17:07:01,"Yes, that's nice, but I have to weigh it up against a cheaper contract and a free 4K TV, hence the difficulty..."
2017-07-15 17:05:31,And I understand for a second tv you need a second box? It's not wireless to all tvs?
2017-07-15 17:03:46,Our city seem to be full of your open shaw wifi! Even at my gym!
2017-07-15 16:58:46,"Do you have fibre optic cables and 4K channels? I'v not made my mind up and not trying to promote them, but you'd have to convince me"

2017-07-15 12:37:30,Well @Shawhelp wants to charge me $18/month for a package to get HBO. That’s a big nope lol. What a rip off for a package. Just want 1 chan
2017-07-15 12:12:03,I’ve got Shaw 150 and it’s great. Shaw support is not offshore—big advantage. Telus offers 150 Mbps up/down in certain areas.
2017-07-15 12:09:30,And the best customer service on here! So quick to respond!
2017-07-15 12:00:29,@Shawhelp as useless as a condom in a trailer park

2017-07-15 11:40:41,Yeah I vote @TELUSsupport as well. Shaw is brutal slow.
2017-07-15 11:40:27,Telus is also awfully slow. Shaw is your best bet Nick.
2017-07-15 11:31:12,For the average consumer these days not much of a difference with the speeds available now but @TELUS is faster with their purefibre.
2017-07-15 11:30:55,Appreciate the quick response! Sounds like you're a fan favorite so far :)
2017-07-15 11:25:59,Shaw
2017-07-15 11:24:45,Telus charges on overage data if ur looking to get wireless. Im hoping to get my family out of telus and over to Shaw.
2017-07-15 11:21:11,I'd go @TELUSsupport as they are doing tons of fiber projects around the lower mainland. 4K and way faster internet.
2017-07-15 11:19:21,"Speedtest and shaw speedtest use the same back end, so I get the same results. Accurate report of U/L speeds, but practical use is low."

2017-07-14 12:18:38,I can't really TS right now unfortunately - just disappointing.
2017-07-14 12:18:01,The issues I had have been looked after for the most part - but I'm at @COREshopping and ShawOpen is spotty & not connecting to music.

2017-07-13 23:00:53,Someone should tell this to @Shawhelp because my internet disconnects every day multiple times.
2017-07-13 22:30:18,4 hours later? Nah it's okay. Calling Shaw tomorrow.
2017-07-13 22:11:00,@Shawhelp no guide info in coquitlam last 4hrs. Tried unpluging for 15sec reboots but still no guide
2017-07-13 21:45:32,@Shawhelp what does the message 'setting up offline environment' mean when you switch the cable box on?
2017-07-13 21:34:02,"And, yes, I DO have a Shaw account."
2017-07-13 21:33:25,"@Shawhelp I can't begin to explain how frustrating trying to log into a Shaw internet site has been tonight, still to no avail. #useless"

2017-07-13 21:20:33,"Yep, that worked! Thanks!"
2017-07-13 21:19:40,@Shawhelp Hi my house is planning to move to Bluesky Limited TV+150. Is the phone included in this bundle? Also can we add Filipino Bundle?
2017-07-13 21:16:35,Common Shaw ! • help her out
2017-07-13 21:15:29,Getting tired of not having internet and tv. @Shawhelp what's wrong
2017-07-13 21:15:19,Tv is working. We don't have shaw phone
2017-07-13 21:12:28,direct to wall jack
2017-07-13 21:10:54,1st (power) is solid. 2nd (receive) is solid. 3rd (send) is blinking. 4th (online) not illuminated. 5th light (PC activity) solid orange

2017-07-13 20:55:21,@Shawhelp what kind of deal can you offer me (without a contract) for internet only?
2017-07-13 20:37:37,Oh! Duh! I do have the return label. A+ suggestion. Thanks!
2017-07-13 20:35:37,"To be fair, they sent me a new router, and the box included return shipping. My old router is just bigger than the new one"
2017-07-13 20:34:50,Yeesh. Mine got lost in the mail and they told me to just go get my own box.

2017-07-13 20:05:18,Hello check your DMs please
2017-07-13 20:03:45,Time to get a new frequency for Global channel. CTV worked fine. Thanks for your time.
2017-07-13 19:57:25,"I get that. But like I said, it's almost like clockwork and restarting the router does nothing. If I wait it out it resolves itself."
2017-07-13 19:57:02,Most likely signal. Global channel gets very choppy with weather.
2017-07-13 19:54:29,"Tried Chrome, Edge and IE. Same thing."
2017-07-13 19:53:23,Nope. It's not that. Cable hasn't been moved. Other channels work properly.
2017-07-13 19:51:49,Not sure how that will help. 100% fine the rest of the day. Not sure why being able to ping or tracert works fine but can't view website.
2017-07-13 19:51:42,I am sorry for the delay. Please see your DMs. Thanks
2017-07-13 19:50:02,we had an appointment for @Shawhelp technician to move services between 5-7 yesterday. I was here all the time. #noshow #badservice #fail
2017-07-13 19:48:25,It's channel based pixelation. Mostly Global Edmonton.
2017-07-13 19:46:25,Seems fine now again but almost every night for the past week or two around that time it seems to happen for about an hour.
2017-07-13 19:45:46,Both wired and wireless. And yes own router. And yes tried power router and modem off then on again. (1/2)
2017-07-13 19:41:29,I worked 2+ years of needing to be available 24-7. I know what it's like. I've never not appreciated the non 8-5 crowd.
2017-07-13 19:07:04,@Shawhelp what gives? every night for the past couple weeks around this time a lot of sites don't load even though tracert or ping works
2017-07-13 19:03:46,@Shawhelp cable's very choppy on this storm day. #yegwx

2017-07-13 18:23:59,Getting pretty ticked with @TELUSsupport & their lack of support/customer service. Our contract is up so believe me seriously considering it
2017-07-13 18:19:31,Done still nothing
2017-07-13 18:14:08,Yes all channels just on this tv
2017-07-13 18:07:56,@Shawhelp no channels are working right
2017-07-13 18:06:59,@Shawhelp why is there no video but there is auto on channel 225 @WWENetwork
2017-07-13 17:35:35,We dont need @Shawhelp to cut our tv signal for weather warnings not even in or around the city we live in... just ruining our shows.

2017-07-13 15:34:09,I was not. Couldn’t get through the username/password prompt.
2017-07-13 15:29:56,"Yeah, I tried both. No offer of a profile and no access to ShawPassport."
2017-07-13 15:08:37,"Yes. If I select it, I’m prompted for a username and password."
2017-07-13 15:06:37,On my iPhone…

2017-07-13 14:43:34,Do you have a new appreciation for those of us that work more than the normal 8-5??
2017-07-13 14:36:37,"Nope, it was just idling doing nothing. About 4 minutes after booting up the PC."

2017-07-12 20:08:19,That seemed to work.
2017-07-12 20:03:25,Thx. It's unnerving to see a warning & have it cut out just as they are announcing the affected area. This can't cont. all summer not safe.
2017-07-12 19:59:02,@Shawhelp My wifi has been down since 4pm..GREAT timing as I have a paper due. Why is ur wifi service so unreliable? This happens too often.

2017-07-12 19:48:41,Thank you. Hopefully this can be resolved soon. Especially for those in direct paths of these severe storms.
2017-07-12 19:47:28,"@Shawhelp If I order HBO later this week to watch Game of Thrones, am I gonna have to pay the price for the whole month?"

2017-07-12 19:32:15,A few days later and while i'm getting a bit more visual- can not hear anything nor read the @AB_EmergAlert that just came across the tv
2017-07-12 19:32:09,Hey @Shawhelp your emergency alerts breaking into my TV shows aren't working.
2017-07-12 19:30:20,ahh man I’m screwed
2017-07-12 19:25:25,Lol...Internet providers playing god seems to be the way of the future. lol
2017-07-12 19:25:19,Sucks that @Shawhelp doesn't have HBO Canada on Free Range TV. Will be on vacation with no legal way to watch #GOT7 . #FirstWorldProblems
2017-07-12 19:24:25,Clearly Shaw doesn't want Steve or I to survive the impending doom
2017-07-12 19:24:13,@Shawhelp hi there. I had a service call booked for between 5-7. No show so far. Little help?
2017-07-12 19:23:19,Pretty sure this violates @CRTCeng policy. They knew about this problem last time there was an emergency alert.
2017-07-12 19:22:31,Worked here in #Bowness
2017-07-12 19:22:24,I saw that... haven't had an issue. /shrug.
2017-07-12 19:21:24,"I think @ShawInfo switched me over to dial-up while I was at work, @shawhelp . Wow, this is sssssssllllllooooooowwwww today."
2017-07-12 19:21:09,I know @SteveTomsYYC had this issue too the other night
2017-07-12 19:20:38,@Shawhelp What's up with the EAS again? Tornado warning then screen goes black and cuts out. Thought you fixed it on the weekend.
2017-07-12 19:19:15,"@Shawhelp I see it's Emerg Alert night again. Do you know they don't come through on Gateway, just freeze the screen? And some choppy audio"
2017-07-12 19:19:15,Weird... mine was fine in Airdrie. Wonder if it only certain types in cable packages.
2017-07-12 19:19:02,@Shawhelp Looks like the EAS notification is glitching the audio and video again. South-west Calgary.
2017-07-12 19:18:55,"@Shawhelp The @AB_EmergAlert still aren't working - sound badly cutting out, just a black screen. #abstorm #yyc #emergencyalert"

2017-07-11 19:10:18,"@shawhelp , Shaw on demand is useless as it's episodes behind; John Oliver's Last Week Tonight for instance. Defeats the purpose."
2017-07-11 19:05:33,Will try but the amount of times wi-fi connections need redoing in general is frustrating. Smart technology is not.

2017-07-11 15:29:58,@Shawhelp So looking at my options with regard to my tv and isp. Why does Shaw limit my upload on Shaw 150. Telus is 150 up and down??

2017-07-10 15:47:16,thanks. Dude needs to remember he's essentially driving an advertising billboard for you. We still Shaw.
2017-07-10 15:46:09,"The fact that @Shawhelp Technician told us that its not his job to secure my Elderly mother's#HomeNetwork tells me,its business not personal"
2017-07-10 15:36:33,Companies @TELUS @Shawhelp @Rogers @RogersHelps have to do more than #LipService along with @CalgaryPolice by taking critism from the public
2017-07-10 15:32:10,Have you called @Shawhelp ? that's the best solution.

2017-07-10 15:19:54,Oh! It seems to be back to normal now. Thanks for the responses though.
2017-07-10 15:18:55,I did that as well.
2017-07-10 15:17:43,Wi-Fi is working but no internet to connect to.
2017-07-10 15:16:17,Power light solid. DS light blinking. No other lights on. Reset modem and the Online light is still off.
2017-07-10 14:55:04,@Shawhelp What's up in Lethbridge? My internet just stopped wprking but TV and phone are fine.
2017-07-10 14:34:11,This is what happens when the EAS center gets @GeorgesLaraque 'd by a hailstorm before it can even send the warning
2017-07-10 13:54:47,When is Shaw rolling out DOCSIS 3.1 and/or Gigabit plans? Rogers has had Gigabit available since 2015 using the same DOCSIS 3.0 as Shaw
2017-07-10 13:46:40,Thats because you havn't had @TELUS Fibre with 150/150 for the past 2+ years and you just don't know any better... unfortunately I do
2017-07-10 13:39:54,"I do mind, but really EVERYTHING... online backups, photo and video uploads, dropbox, onedrive, remote desktop, streaming my home media, etc"
2017-07-10 13:28:03,Can you help @TELUS run a fibre line to my house? Because I need more than 15mbps upload speed
2017-07-10 13:00:04,"I'l give that a try too. Thanks for all your help, Lance! Cheers!"

2017-07-10 12:28:29,@Shawhelp Hi there! My Arris PVR is making a loud whirring noise on a regular basis. Only had it for 7 months. Should I be concerned?
2017-07-10 11:59:04,It's back up. Was about a 30min delay in south nanaimo.
2017-07-10 11:47:21,@Shawhelp service disruption in Nanaimo?
2017-07-10 10:21:47,Sure.
2017-07-10 10:11:48,@Shawhelp Now my internet is cutting in and out.
2017-07-10 09:51:48,@Shawhelp is there an outage in SW Calgary right now?
2017-07-10 09:36:58,"@Shawhelp Are there outages in Abbotsford? Was watching news, and now all I get is ref code: S0a00"
2017-07-10 09:23:52,"You got more than I did. I just had an annoying intermittent beep and nothing on the screen. Annoying, not informative."
2017-07-10 08:40:55,Thank you
2017-07-10 08:32:12,@Shawhelp . Is Shaw Go WiFi now Shaw Passpoint?
2017-07-10 08:15:01,"Good Morning Shaun & Harvey,quick question-are we experiencing interruptions in the NE YYC today?I've had to keep rebooting my router. Thnx!"
2017-07-10 06:31:20,@Shawhelp Internet down in St. Albert? Flashing on receive and won't go any further. We're in Braeside and service keeps cutting lately.
2017-07-09 23:58:52,...ish
2017-07-09 23:58:22,"Too weird. I read their alert on their tweet to you indicating Edmonton and area. I guess 4 hour drive from Edmonton must be ""area""."
2017-07-09 23:54:53,"Same, but friend half a block away on Shaw was fine."
2017-07-09 23:54:05,"The screen would freeze, go black with Shaw Gateway unable to broadcast msg, intermittent garbled noise with red banner at top of screen."
2017-07-09 23:53:23,"It didn't improve, but storm passed so yay!"
2017-07-09 23:51:06,Hope they fixed it. Useless to have alerts otherwise. We were watching Global Toronto on timeshift & every alert did same which was odd.
2017-07-09 23:44:59,@Shawhelp I brought back my cable box and you guys are charging me the équipement for 348$. Seriously????
2017-07-09 23:27:36,Put the cartridge in and press it up and down like 10 times ... that should fix it
2017-07-09 22:02:36,Hope so-terrible timing for an outage... #lifealerts
2017-07-09 21:58:31,Pondering #emergencyalert on tv tonight #couldntseeanything tv kept scrambling #nothelpful is this being fixed?
2017-07-09 21:53:34,no but I did inquire about Internet 150 a while ago
2017-07-09 21:51:55,"Tons of those, every 7 min or so. Weird!"
2017-07-09 21:51:05,Oh I think you saw the text crawls. I was looking for one of these: https:// youtu.be/jsry5Y75D6E
2017-07-09 21:49:12,We are watching Global on @Shawhelp and it's alert city. (Also they spelled Penhold wrong but whatever)

2017-07-09 21:30:47,"Thanks, didn't see the outage information"

2017-07-09 21:28:29,@Shawhelp @AB_EmergAlert might want to fix the digital box/cable EAS performance ASAP...
2017-07-09 21:27:36,@Shawhelp You're not properly brodcasting the warning. It's just a garbled mess.
2017-07-09 21:27:07,Could you maybe tweet what is is trying to tell us?
2017-07-09 21:26:46,"First time I saw it was a couple years ago, but it worked perfectly then."
2017-07-09 21:26:46,Happening again. Seriously. Am I bout to be killed??
2017-07-09 21:20:12,@Shawhelp what's with internet speed these days? Pretty slow over here in Pitt Meadows
2017-07-09 21:18:51,"So, I should be getting alerts or not? Are these failed alerts not even for us?"
2017-07-09 21:17:39,"The last blank screen, the digital box said EAS, so I assume that is an alert not getting through? I know we don't have a tornado alert tho"
2017-07-09 21:17:13,Thanks so much
2017-07-09 21:16:06,"they should be tweeting about failed alerts, then. The only service outage notice is the blank screen one: https:// community.shaw.ca/docs/DOC-12389"
2017-07-09 21:15:50,Thanks. Appreciate the feedback.
2017-07-09 21:13:43,I was wondering the same!

2017-07-09 21:11:21,"Hello fellow Etsian and Calgarian =) No alerts yet, Calgary is just a Thunderstorm watch."
2017-07-09 21:11:10,You are seeing more than I! I couldn't figure out what was going on until I saw your tweet!

2017-07-09 21:09:18,Why can't the AB alerts stop since they aren't working? They aren't even related to the Calgary area...

2017-07-09 20:13:19,"@Shawhelp The same thing here. Tv pixilated, sound goes off except for some squawks and then comes back after the emergency alert is over https:// twitter.com/Shawhelp/statu s/884232575497101312 …"
2017-07-09 20:13:19,Lol yeah I just read that. They say great minds think alike. I guess we do too.

2017-07-09 20:09:24,Hey @Shawhelp any idea why the emergency alert looks like it's being played on an 8bit NES and the cartridge needs blowing on? pic.twitter.com/bmdNK6UBD1
2017-07-09 20:09:13,Don't mind the interruptions for actual alerts
2017-07-09 20:08:58,@Shawhelp are there warnings going out over tv for tornado? If so not working properly: just a lot of static
2017-07-09 20:08:48,@Shawhelp Is there any way you can tell me what the Alert is for Red Deer...it's glitching out
2017-07-09 20:08:08,@Shawhelp what's going on with cable tonight? Keeps glitching and turning to CTV channel. Annoying. #okotoks
2017-07-09 20:08:05,"Yep, same shit!!! Get it together @Shawhelp"

2017-07-09 20:05:28,"yes... it worked fine, but too often for a storm that's not near me."
2017-07-09 20:03:29,.Just DM'd
2017-07-09 20:02:24,it ran fine in English and then French.
2017-07-09 20:00:08,. Another one @Shawhelp
2017-07-09 19:56:27,@Shawhelp my tv pixalates when the emergency alarm system comes on. Can't read the notice. Sound goes in and out too. Defeats the alert
2017-07-09 19:55:45,Same problem in Sask last week. Was told it's the individual channel that carries them and not @ShawDirect @Shawhelp clarification?
2017-07-09 19:54:52,I had the same issue tonight. Didn't see any alert.
2017-07-09 19:53:15,. @Shawhelp you REALLY need to look into this. Just heard bits & pieces of another one but that's it. Doesn't do anyone any good #abstorm
2017-07-09 19:50:48,"@Shawhelp weather warning, we know, we googled, now plz stop trying it's not working and ruining my shows #yyc"
2017-07-09 19:50:33,Hey @shawhelp ! What's up with the emergency warning system? It is all garbled and isn't passing on important info. #abweather #yyc
2017-07-09 19:50:29,@Shawhelp hi the emergency alert system isn't functioning properly. Tv just pauses and once had a strip of the banner with frozen screen
2017-07-09 19:50:01,@Shawhelp what's up? Our gateways keep tripping off... only way to recover is unplug and reboot. Annoying!?!?!
2017-07-09 19:49:47,@Shawhelp hey maybe tell the cable department their Emergency Alerts tonight for the AB tornadoes are less than helpful. pic.twitter.com/6ihoveBiww
2017-07-09 19:49:44,"Already do, and will do so momentarily"
2017-07-09 19:49:43,@Shawhelp every one of these emergency alerts has looked and sounded like this. Problem on your end? pic.twitter.com/OLVz43OR3K
2017-07-09 19:49:29,4 times in 25 minutes I've had to sit thru a warning that doesn't affect me.
2017-07-09 19:48:52,"Ha, it sure sounded odd!"
2017-07-09 19:47:37,Also times where it just messes with my audio
2017-07-09 19:42:15,Completely disagree. @Shawhelp has been great.
2017-07-09 19:41:08,"thanks for letting complain :) Hope you have a good night, in a nice air conditioned office."
2017-07-09 19:32:44,Same problem happening here. Every few minutes the EAS or EA5 error and garbled sound and video.
2017-07-09 19:32:26,i have cause yeah that's the other thing.. it cuts off my PVR recording as well :( .. can it not be timed for commercials?! :p
2017-07-09 19:30:48,@Shawhelp I realize this is likely not your responsibility but thought maybe someone could let them know.
2017-07-09 19:30:25,@Shawhelp these environmental warnings aren't coming through properly. Sound is glitchy and can hear a thing
2017-07-09 19:30:10,@Shawhelp the Emergency Alert system has broken in to programming several times over the last 15 minutes but it's completely garbled
2017-07-09 19:29:58,Will Shaw fix alerts to ensure we can understand them in the future? concerning as it isn't doing its job! See here http://www. emergencyalert.alberta.ca
2017-07-09 19:28:10,yeah but why is it the whole province? I'm no where near the area... dude .. midseason finale! common....as french? in Alberta.. really? ;)
2017-07-09 19:27:59,@Shawhelp emergency alert has frozen our system have unplugged box to see if it helps still frozen - #yyc downtown area
2017-07-09 19:23:12,@Shawhelp you may want to take a look at the EAS system...this is all that was showing this evening: pic.twitter.com/ZsNMzv058r
2017-07-09 19:23:04,@Shawhelp uggg why is my show being interrupted for a weather warning hours north of me :( missing the mid-season finale of FtWD :(
2017-07-09 19:22:22,All my tvs did the same. Kind of pointless if you can't hear the alert
2017-07-09 19:21:11,It is the warning system but as I said it's all choppy and couldn't make it out
2017-07-09 19:20:53,@Shawhelp is this an emergency alert system notice that isn't working? 2/2
2017-07-09 19:20:47,@Shawhelp what's up with the emergency alert? It's scrambling can't hear it and takes awhile to go back to regular TV
2017-07-09 19:20:20,@Shawhelp what is going on with the cable
2017-07-09 19:20:10,"I believe it's environment Canada trying to issue an emergency alert. My tv is frozen as well, it isn't working"
2017-07-09 19:19:58,"For the second time in 5 minutes I've lost all video, it appears to be the warning system but it's all choppy"
2017-07-09 19:19:50,@Shawhelp we keeping having an EAS coding come up on the box but a black screen with broken words being said. What gives? 1/2
2017-07-09 19:15:01,@Shawhelp anything going on in Calgary right now?
2017-07-09 18:51:05,It just started working . The red froze with a warning but it was scramble.
2017-07-09 18:10:04,@Shawhelp my tv is red deer is frozen with a red warning
2017-07-09 18:04:01,@Shawhelp sent you a DM!
2017-07-09 17:54:48,@Shawhelp what would be the reasoning for why we haven't had cable since Saturday morning.. someone can't visit us until Thursday?!
2017-07-09 17:46:06,Appreciate the offer but I'm going to switch to #glassfibre network. Been with #Shaw for years - rate has gone up every year. #notcool
2017-07-09 17:22:55,I hope the @NASCAR_Trucks race is on a channel other than @FS1 in Canada. I don't get that in @ShawInfo @Shawhelp
2017-07-09 15:28:09,Just noticed @Shawhelp announced yet ANOTHER rate increase. I think it's time to look at better options #glassfibre #yyc
2017-07-09 15:23:40,Just did :)
2017-07-09 15:17:00,@Shawhelp I've rebooted my shaw box but it still says No IP. What should I do?
2017-07-09 14:55:32,No. Always crashes between 12 and 2. It really hinders zak's ability to work from home
2017-07-09 14:54:10,Right now I'm fone!
2017-07-09 14:51:36,Does your internet ever work?
2017-07-09 14:44:55,@Shawhelp my internet has been out for an hour yet again what the hell??
2017-07-09 14:39:17,I am. And sometimes it goes black for ~10 seconds at a time. And the box gets too hot to touch.
2017-07-09 14:36:06,@Shawhelp Why is my mini bluesky box serving me 90's glitch art realness?
2017-07-09 14:18:53,Right? Love the (lack of) service.
2017-07-09 14:18:06,They said last night some houses in the are were affected and were sending someone out... If it was just us we should have had a call set up
2017-07-09 13:38:34,"@Shawhelp so all services down...tech booked for AUGUST 1st! Wtf!? 3 weeks to see a tech? Time to call telus, methinks."
2017-07-09 13:18:51,@Shawhelp
2017-07-09 13:18:01,@Shawhelp
2017-07-09 11:29:04,Then YouTube it is. Thanks 4 checking.
2017-07-09 10:57:05,I wish @BBCEarth on @Shawhelp would actually start recording at the proper times. Most shows start 5-10 mins earlier then the guide shows.
2017-07-09 10:54:59,@Shawhelp Any idea what channel/time the FIBA U19 Men's final CANADA vs Italy is on 2day? Can only find it on YouTube.
2017-07-09 10:37:20,"Really liking my new @Shawhelp BlueSky setup. Should out to our installer Mike for being great. Shaw, will you give him a commendation?"
2017-07-09 09:32:42,Done
2017-07-09 09:27:25,We switched our home phone to shaw but our number now comes up as unknown when calling out so sometimes get blocked . How do we unblock?

2017-07-08 22:10:05,@Shawhelp internet is functioning but considerably slower than normal. Is this due to the fires around WL?
2017-07-08 22:03:17,In Alberta

2017-07-06 12:37:12,It actually already resolved itself. I think it was related to some downtime last night. Thanks though!

2017-07-06 10:29:30,@shawhelp @ShawInfo @shawtech . Internet down in White Rock. Please fix! Thank you.
2017-07-06 09:57:40,@Shawhelp 'these speeds do appear to be correct for the service' really? Less than 1mbps? #hammerinthepants #lessthanhelpful
2017-07-06 09:35:07,Csr has offered to credit for unused services but it doesn't give me back the money I had to spend on more phone data and time wasted.

2017-07-06 07:42:26,I'm not sure the switch to BlueSky TV w @Shawhelp was worth it. Every month I've had it has had a problem.

2017-07-05 22:26:57,Is the interruption in pg from the car accident or is it a different reason?
2017-07-05 22:17:07,How is it #shaw doesn't have a backup line that runs somewhere else? Interruptions seems to be happening more frequently! @Shawhelp
2017-07-05 21:36:37,Maybe put that on the website that everyone is checking...
2017-07-05 21:32:31,@Shawhelp 2 hours since last update. Maybe time to let people know what’s going on?
2017-07-05 21:24:07,Kind of important to get that out first! Thanks for the update!
2017-07-05 21:20:01,@Shawhelp any update on the outage in Prince George?

2017-07-04 18:18:26,@Shawhelp Hey my internet is down in Holyrood Edmonton. Is this normal?
2017-07-04 18:18:25,"Definitely see if you can get closer to the source, like the electrical panel. Or right where the wore comes in to the place."
2017-07-04 18:17:59,Well now it's solid. I left the room a few minutes ago!
2017-07-04 18:17:07,Flashing online doesn't mean it's online. Off then on then steady flashing means cannot connect.
2017-07-04 18:14:48,"Like the light flashes that it's online, so if the modem was broken, wouldn't that mean I'd get no indication? Hmmm."
2017-07-04 18:13:04,Not sure.
2017-07-04 18:08:46,Well we just replaced the coax cable and still the same problem. It's either the modem or the wall mount/line.
2017-07-04 17:59:24,Do you have somewhere you can get to closer to where that cable comes in? Electrical room.. or is that it?
2017-07-04 17:58:02,"Oh shit. No flashing is not the same thing at all. Long off means attempting, then flashing online means no signal gave up."
2017-07-04 17:57:56,Or the modem is dying. One of the two.
2017-07-04 17:56:06,I think the power surge fried the coax cable. It worked for half a second. The online is flashing but not solid.
2017-07-04 17:55:18,@shawhelp why doesn't the guide on the gateway show the programs; it just lists numbers. I can't schedule a recording for tonight at 20:00

2017-07-04 17:45:11,"That's funny, since it is actually just a peice of copper. It should never need to he unplugged, either end. Gremlins I think."
2017-07-04 17:45:01,Thanks everyone for your help.
2017-07-04 17:43:47,Awesome! Sounds like dust or static or Gremlins was your issue. Glad it didn't require a tech visit.
2017-07-04 17:43:17,Simply removing the coax cable from the machine didn't work. But magic happened when I removed it from the wall.

2017-07-04 17:42:04,Finally got it to work. Had to unplug the coax cable from the wall and screw it back in.
2017-07-04 17:36:53,Power cable last.
2017-07-04 17:36:46,"You can try unplugging everything from the back of the cable modem. Very rarely, but sometimes static plays culprit. Wait 90secs plug in."
2017-07-04 17:35:17,"No, you need solid online light, otherwise the dlink has no access anyhow. That online light is the first point of access in your place."

2017-07-04 17:25:41,No online light means cable down. Your tv ok? You'll have to call support. A truck roll is likely.

2017-07-03 17:07:30,"@Shawhelp internet keeps dropping, Burnaby Metrotown area. Wired and wireless. Came back up for a bit now has dropped for a while."

2017-07-03 12:41:37,"I have iop already installed as Our modem/router is up, desktops down. We have a wifi issue just out back door."

2017-06-22 18:16:31,Thanks.
2017-06-22 18:12:51,@Shawhelp can't get into my email on my laptop #winnipeg Get sign in page but pswd returns page not found.
2017-06-22 18:10:02,"I'm glad it's not just me. It told me to reenter my password, then said it couldn't verify it; https:// webmail.shaw.ca / won't connect at all."
2017-06-22 18:08:34,"Dear @Shawhelp , it would be helpful if you made a generic tweet about the issue so that we aren't all individually trying to troubleshoot"
2017-06-22 17:59:41,Hey @Shawhelp whats up with webmail? Is it down?
2017-06-22 17:54:55,"@Shawhelp Unacceptable. I need to access my email, NOW! Like I said, unacceptable, especially considering what u charge for your services!"
2017-06-22 17:36:18,I see
2017-06-22 17:32:56,Anyone else not receiving Shaw emails this afternoon? @Shawhelp
2017-06-22 17:32:03,Thanks!
2017-06-22 17:32:02,@Shawhelp Email out in Victoria - when will this be fixed?
2017-06-22 17:30:03,Thanks! Any idea how long it might be down for?
2017-06-22 17:26:54,@Shawhelp hey my webmail seems to be down. Just checking to see if this something that's being looked into
2017-06-22 17:24:13,Thank you
2017-06-22 17:20:23,"@Shawhelp Can't access Webmail via your website, my Outlook account or via my cell phone. Is webmail down? Thanks."
2017-06-22 17:12:16,"great, thank you!"
2017-06-22 17:09:19,@Shawhelp Hello! Is webmail down?
2017-06-22 16:24:01,As I get older being on my sht!t gets harder and harder. Lol.
2017-06-22 16:14:47,Yeah. I have regular shaw. So no app. I have to be on my sh*t for pvr lol.
2017-06-22 16:13:13,"Well, it worked out to cheaper, which is why I upgraded. The menu system is much faster and better than Gateway. But pissed about the app."
2017-06-22 16:06:12,I think Blue Sky is a sham lol Voice command is the best they can come up with?
2017-06-22 16:03:18,@Shawhelp can you guys please stop calling me? Several times a day. It's annoying. Pls help.
2017-06-22 15:54:59,Good question. If a new system is an upgrade it must offer the features of old system plus more. Otherwise don't bother
2017-06-22 15:53:36,So did I...and Blue Sky doesn't. It's very annoying. Why would you launch a new system and not have that functionality?
2017-06-22 15:52:28,I love that Gateway has the app and you can set recordings away from home if you forgot to do it earlier
2017-06-22 15:33:52,"I used to be able to do that with Shaw. Then I ""upgraded"" and lost that ability."
2017-06-22 15:33:04,"You ""hope"". I upgraded from Gateway and was told, it will be coming for sure. Speaking to the remote doesn't help when you forgot to record."
2017-06-22 15:16:22,Bell Fibe is awesome. I can set anything from my phone.
2017-06-22 15:10:43,"Sure glad I can set PVR recordings remotely with my Blue Sky TV app. Oh wait, I can't. @Shawhelp"
2017-06-22 14:24:03,I think you tagged the wrong RM house?
2017-06-22 14:02:28,"I have rebooted multiple times. Both TV and internet are still completely down. Tv saying ""hunt"" and modem DS light blinking."
2017-06-22 13:11:32,@Shawhelp any issues in west Edmonton (Belmead area specifically)? Internet and TV both down all morning for me.
2017-06-22 13:00:18,Looks to be back up now. Thanks!
2017-06-22 12:53:50,@Shawhelp Any issues in Squamish? Internet just dropped out. Restarting modem didn’t work.
2017-06-22 12:11:33,"Nah, this is on Telus’ end at this point. They refused to allow the transfer. Fun."
2017-06-22 11:33:03,Hey! I'll try the pinhole :) Thanks!
2017-06-22 11:23:52,@shawhelp - also have changed both the 2.4 and the 5ghz wireless channels incase interference. Not helping. Still dipping :(
2017-06-22 11:23:27,@Shawhelp Gettin incredibly slow speeds on hardwire connection. Tried powercycle and the speed is dipping incredibly. Any thoughts?
2017-06-22 10:43:46,Thanks will do.
2017-06-22 10:40:55,@Shawhelp Can you tell me if there are businesses in Vancouver having internet outages?
2017-06-22 10:01:24,No it isn't. Just an endless loop of the buffering symbol and nothing will load up
2017-06-22 09:48:24,@Shawhelp Why is my TV Not working? Scheduled maintennce is over and neither ShawChat or telephone rep seems to have a clue.Patterson SW
2017-06-22 09:32:15,Sure have. Within the last 10 months. Just don't see the benefit of staying with Shaw when we can pay far less for similar service elsewhere
2017-06-22 09:25:40,Stop charging so much for your services we are looking at other options as the costs are too expensive (and increasing by the sound of it)
2017-06-22 08:59:28,"My Ma and pa have been with Shaw for a long time. I’m interested in the fastest internet,"
2017-06-22 08:58:10,Am I able to have a family member add my @shaw .ca email address to their account so I don't lose it?
2017-06-22 08:52:37,Bluesky had been good to me. Internet has been fast and consistent. @Shawhelp
2017-06-22 08:41:27,Our #Radiothon phone lines are powered by the great people @shawhelp - thank you for your support in helping callers help kids! pic.twitter.com/0joTUobDG7
2017-06-22 08:40:55,Can you lower my bill amount without removing channels? On my latest invoice I noticed it's going up by another $11
2017-06-22 04:23:21,@Shawhelp any idea what the August 1st increase is for your Internet 25 plan (or any of your plans to be honest). Thinking about options....
2017-06-22 00:21:47,@Shawhelp any word on our internet/cable returning to red deer?
2017-06-21 23:04:43,Sorry just being pedantic. June 20th this year
2017-06-21 22:59:48,Psst. Yesterday was the first day of Summer this year
2017-06-21 22:55:23,Since last tweet to you have bin on hold or with them it's plane forget
2017-06-21 22:48:59,I have thank you!!
2017-06-21 22:42:03,Answers your phone within 20 minutes and under exaggerated
2017-06-21 22:37:46,@Shawhelp Its nice when you need help I don't exsist but if I'm $20 short on a bill you get off your ads pretty fast
2017-06-21 22:34:20,This also seems to have had no effect
2017-06-21 22:25:19,Seems to have had no effect
2017-06-21 22:15:32,"I'll have to look into that, the interference is about as annoying as the patronizing replies from customer care."
2017-06-21 22:13:40,"It's odd. When I had Shaw's garbage router and awful service, I often suffered ""interference"". Now, with Optik, no more interference!"
2017-06-21 22:13:24,We've unplugged and plugged the main portal already
2017-06-21 22:13:08,Thanks. Yes on all tv's.
2017-06-21 22:11:09,@Shawhelp our TV guide hasn't shown programming for a few days now. Help? pic.twitter.com/OSuGFyEk1h

2017-06-21 22:03:11,How does everything work perfectly for weeks then randomly not?
2017-06-21 21:56:19,Vancouver
2017-06-21 21:54:12,Do you guys use a standardized reply to complaints of this nature?
2017-06-21 21:11:32,Thanks.
2017-06-21 21:03:26,Why is SYTYCD carried Mondays but not the rest of the week on Fox? I don't see it listed tonight but it is on. Very disappointing Shaw.
2017-06-21 21:01:24,https:// community.shaw.ca/docs/DOC-12281 for updates but no updates posted.
2017-06-21 21:01:01,"I'm in the same building as @deryell . I know you're working on it, just complaining for the sake of complaining :D"
2017-06-21 20:56:36,Thanks for the quick reply
2017-06-21 20:56:33,Still broken :(
2017-06-21 20:49:52,I don't get it till midnight here in Winnipeg I'll have to watch it tomorrow! @Shawhelp
2017-06-21 20:27:07,"Have an account, submitted online 2 days ago. No call of email."
2017-06-21 20:16:56,I see tweets that it was on Fox yesterday and today too.....?
2017-06-21 20:14:02,@Shawhelp I'd like to have internet when I move into my new home. Why is nobody getting back to me?
2017-06-21 20:00:09,"@Shawhelp fox hd is actually city, and my Shaw on demand box hasn't worked for TV shows in two weeks."
2017-06-21 19:52:03,Okay thanks! :)
2017-06-21 19:51:23,I'm watching Fox HD and it's Modern Family. SYTYCD isn't listed for the rest of the evening
2017-06-21 19:47:50,@Shawhelp are there outages in Calgary (esp. Chinook area)? Internet is down here. Tried resetting router etc and no luck.
2017-06-21 19:46:50,Any eta on #yyc Windsor park area resolution? @Shawhelp over an hour of no internet services.
2017-06-21 19:41:43,"Thanks and no it's not a company computer , it's a personal one"
2017-06-21 19:39:06,Or do I have to be on my home network ?
2017-06-21 19:38:45,@Shawhelp just wondering if my McAfee antivirus from shaw will work on my work laptop if I'm not at home ?
2017-06-21 19:35:19,I pay #Shaw way to much for the internet speed I am experiencing. #greedy #losers @shawinfo @shawhelp
2017-06-21 19:35:02,Wish I could find SYTYCD on my cable provider @Shawhelp
2017-06-21 19:31:11,That seems to have fixed it. Thanks!
2017-06-21 19:28:43,"It was on the guide, yes. I'm in the process of powering back up."
2017-06-21 19:18:51,I obviously cant confirm what is on Channel 27 at the moment.
2017-06-21 19:17:41,Not on any other channel I have. Awards are showing in lowdef on SNO and SNP
2017-06-21 19:07:07,@Shawhelp Sportsnet West (channel 27) currently a black screen with no sound. Whats up with that?
2017-06-21 18:29:03,"@Shawhelp Thanks for the maintenance in my area last night, my internet has been practically unusable since. GG"
2017-06-21 18:28:27,@Shawhelp Is Internet down in West Vancouver?
2017-06-21 17:52:03,i got mine back at 0730....i also shamelessly flirted....
2017-06-21 17:32:34,Makes it difficult to get work done. Thanks though! I appreciate the efforts to get everything restored
2017-06-21 17:28:48,I've had no internet all day. Any word when it'll be back up?
2017-06-21 16:39:01,@Shawhelp I just got a warning from my @McAfee app that Shaw open is being hacked?
2017-06-21 16:24:26,Our @ShawInfo team is working hard to get services back up & running in @CityofRedDeer . If you are experiencing an outage contact @Shawhelp
2017-06-21 16:13:47,I DM'd my info.
2017-06-21 16:05:30,I shouldn't have to buy a new one. THIS one should work fine. Especially for the inflated price I paid for it!!
2017-06-21 16:04:28,The Late Late Show also shared the time slot & recorded w/o hesitation. This PVR has done this MANY many times & I hate it for that.
2017-06-21 16:03:11,No. I'm very careful when arranging my programmed recordings. The only thing recording the same time was iZombie. (1/2)
2017-06-21 15:55:05,The reason given by this hateful machine is one that never happened. It pulls this crap a lot. Too much. pic.twitter.com/XGt7Te3Iur

2017-06-21 15:20:19,"Being told I don't qualify (10 year customer) and can pay $184/month is not ok, when fam/friends got the lower rate."
2017-06-21 15:19:02,@ShawInfo @Shawhelp Basically everyone I know can get Shaw150 & Blue Sky TV for $99 except for me? Your intro prices make no sense.
2017-06-21 15:02:36,Then @Shawhelp cancelled the one Calgary Community Access Channel and fired all my friends at Shaw TV... Only reason I signed. 190 monthly..
2017-06-21 15:00:54,So wild! I got conned into a 2 year plan with #bluesky and Internet but it barely worked. Tried to cancell 5 days later and they said no...
2017-06-21 14:52:44,"Stressed last night, thought I wouldn't be working today due to #rdstorm . Thanks @CityofRedDeer & @Shawhelp for restoring & #amworking"

2017-06-21 10:49:13,@Shawhelp who do I call about my internet problems?
2017-06-21 10:35:48,Thanks for the speedy reply.
2017-06-21 10:35:20,Not to worry it was back so fast I didn't even have time to respond back to you. All is fine.
2017-06-21 10:25:58,Our Shaw crews are working with @CityofRedDeer to restore services. If you are experiencing a loss of services contact @shawhelp

2017-06-20 14:25:07,"To make matters worse, the fast-forward functionality is just as bad, so it's a pain to catch up to where I was. BitTorrent is better :P"
2017-06-20 14:22:12,@Shawhelp The fact that My Orders expire after 24 hours is terrible. Sometimes I want to continue a show after a few days but can't.
2017-06-20 13:57:04,hi how you sam
2017-06-20 13:46:35,my Shaw has been comiing snd going the past week or so
2017-06-20 12:24:25,Thanks!
2017-06-20 12:21:59,What's going on with @Shawhelp my cable and internet keep going on and off! West end Edmonton
2017-06-20 10:53:25,Not sure why we can't just get it at the same time. Thought this whole difference between the States and Canada for TV was over. Ugh.
2017-06-20 10:41:00,"Thank you, I'll get back to you if it isn't sorted soon."
2017-06-20 10:22:36,"Yes called Fri. Told it was just us. No, it's our whole street. I'm concerned that you have no way to detect when cable lines are down."
2017-06-20 10:22:32,A new season started in the U.S last Saturday. Still nothing on the Shaw owned DTour channel here and no response to my question about it.
2017-06-20 10:08:39,I'm pretty excited too!
2017-06-20 09:59:33,Is it 9:24 pm yet? Call me when it is.
2017-06-20 09:57:04,The all powerful Google says otherwise pic.twitter.com/FORMVWQelw
2017-06-20 08:33:19,Can you please check kens notes regarding my account about firmware updates to our blue sky please
2017-06-20 08:22:26,So disconnecting the coax is the key in a reset?
2017-06-20 08:17:56,"Managed to get a quick cycle, coax disconnect in. Looks like we're back in business! Thx Harvey!"
2017-06-20 08:13:07,"Unfortunately I need to leave for work now. The modem has been cycled multiple times, although I never disconnected the coax"
2017-06-20 08:08:51,"Power, blue, blue, green @, flashing computer"

2017-06-20 07:54:46,@Shawhelp Any issues in West Ormsby? Internet went down at midnight (your planned outage) but hasn't come back up.
2017-06-20 01:47:51,"Of course! Thanks for the shoutout, would love a RT as well if you can. Keep staying blessed."
2017-06-19 23:31:25,@Shawhelp my potato internet package with you guys is the equivalent to a geriatric potato
2017-06-19 23:09:51,@Shawhelp What am I paying for? Cause as of rite now it seems like I'm paying for WI-FI that buffers Every five seconds... Wth.
2017-06-19 22:37:49,THANKS! Much appreciated.
2017-06-19 22:36:14,Perfect! It's fixed. Thank you!
2017-06-19 22:32:29,Not fully sure. We will continue to monitor so we can report back. Tonight it was with Dancing with the Stars.
2017-06-19 22:28:02,"Nope, always with recording."
2017-06-19 22:27:43,"Gateway system is already set up in the house. Bought a new tv, want to control new tv with gateway remote"
2017-06-19 22:23:30,"Can I do this tomorrow? I need to go to sleep as I work at 2:30am. Thank you for the prompt response, though. Excellent service, as always."
2017-06-19 22:21:29,@Shawhelp how do you add a new tv to the gateway remote so you only use one remote?
2017-06-19 22:18:34,"I'm at 60%. It doesn't matter. If I have 10 or 20%, the PVR still omits the two shows. It especially hates Tosh.0, refusing to record, often"
2017-06-19 22:16:29,"With the case of the Colbert Late Show, I have to check it minutes before it's supposed to record, to ensure it's set. Sucks if not at home."
2017-06-19 22:15:14,"I write down everything that I plan to record. After I set it, if I don't double check day of the recording, those 2 shows get rejected."
2017-06-19 22:12:58,"Had been going since before 9pm, it just stopped"
2017-06-19 22:12:29,"Clicking (static sound) this is the only network, also happening on Fox regular channel. All other channels fine."
2017-06-19 22:10:58,Seems my Shaw Cable PVR hates Stephen Colbert & Daniel Tosh as it refuses to record either show unless entered repeatedly. Why @Shawhelp ??
2017-06-19 22:05:46,@Shawhelp something is sooo wrong with the sound on fox HD (ch 203) #soannoying
2017-06-19 21:51:38,"I've been a customer for two years and was told, at time of booking appointment, that it will be free of charge."

2017-06-19 17:49:57,"@Shawhelp The Manny Pacquiao fight was announced to be broadcasted on ESPN, will it be available here in Canada?"

2017-06-16 14:49:33,And certainly your staff shouldn't insist asking peoples' passwords over chat. This is inappropriate & shows your poor training standards
2017-06-16 14:48:31,Can you call @Shawhelp and get that ball rolling?
2017-06-16 14:44:01,It seems like u're the one in need of some help understanding internet security. You shldn't need people's passwords to look at their acc's

2017-06-16 10:17:34,@Shawhelp Hi! What's the best way to let Shaw know that you're impressed with some excellent help you rec'd thru Shaw? Email? Or..?
2017-06-16 10:13:11,"Hi Lance. I'm tied to Telus until November for my cell phone, but it'd be the lot. Phone, TV, internet, cell phone. Thanks."
2017-06-16 10:01:36,@Shawhelp just so you know MSNBC is showing the Canadian video feed with the American audio which makes for interesting commercials.
2017-06-16 09:57:58,Looks like all is working again. Thanks
2017-06-16 09:57:11,P.p.p.s ShawPasspoint is average at best. Use it for iPhone and iPad. I connect using MacBook mostly. Passpoint no good for that
2017-06-16 09:50:33,Any word on possible problems?
2017-06-16 09:46:59,P.s. Forced to use a TELUS hotspot earlier this week because of this. They have been gunning for my biz for years.
2017-06-16 09:45:43,"Phil, it's happening with Windows devices too (my client). I simply cannot rely on Shaw Go Wifi anymore. It's not just me."
2017-06-16 09:40:46,"P.s. Phil, I have a client who had same issue recently. As soon as we connected to www using a new non-Shaw hotspot, problem went away."
2017-06-16 09:39:30,No thanks. That is not going to solve the problem. I know of many in my biz network who have the same complaint.
2017-06-16 09:38:56,@Shawhelp Are your internet services down in Nelson BC area?
2017-06-16 09:35:34,Good morning! It's all good this morning. No sub channels showing. Thanks!
2017-06-16 09:33:57,Perhaps when you get asked to pay your Shaw bill in a timely fashion you can explain that times of maintenance have backed up your schedule?
2017-06-16 09:31:54,Well if you tried again that should have fixed it. The pop up said so. Hey Shaw get the man his golf. And make it snappy.
2017-06-16 09:30:19,Did you try again?

2017-06-14 21:27:30,@Shawhelp any news on when the outtage in South Calgary will be fixed? We need to know what happens in #OITNB ! @Netflix_CA
2017-06-14 20:19:55,Especially since if I knew a year ago I could care less about cable! I wanted to downgrade but it's cheaper for me to keep my expensive plan
2017-06-14 20:17:51,Guess it's the 2 year value plan. I don't care if my contract extends 2 months to not have to pay $112 for 2 months of not using it.
2017-06-14 19:16:36,Disappointed @TheMist (June 27) is only on @spike TV here in #YYC . #SpikeTV (chan43) isn't even in glorious HD on #ShawCable @Shawhelp
2017-06-14 18:45:27,"I've tried different channels and I can't seem to get anything up, the stuff that's recorded or VOD won't come up either"

2017-06-14 17:07:35,Is this for new or existing clients?
2017-06-14 17:03:17,@Shawhelp #bluesky have you changed the price plans for this service lately?
2017-06-14 16:46:54,At the door every week. They are hitting west Edmonton hard!

2017-06-14 15:27:19,@Shawhelp no Internet at our business
2017-06-14 15:26:31,Direct connection. Close enough I could lick my router. Using a cat6 or whatever the best Ethernet cable is too
2017-06-14 15:19:23,"@Shawhelp hello, my internet speeds are being completely slashed. I just reset my modem. I'm getting speeds below 1mbps when I have shaw150"

2017-06-14 00:57:52,I am guessing you turned off your modem for a few minutes?
2017-06-14 00:38:52,@Shawhelp seriously your gone offline for the 6th time today -! UGGGGGG what is wrong with your system -
2017-06-14 00:10:12,"Looking through the community, people have been looking for an ETA on this issue for 6 months or more. Will an ETA happen this year? Next?"
2017-06-13 23:47:50,They usually do.
2017-06-13 23:46:59,They probably going to suggest you unplug box for 30 seconds to reset the box.
2017-06-13 23:25:57,@Shawhelp Do you have any suggestions what to do if my refurb Motorola DCX3400-M won't delete programs I've watched?

2017-06-13 16:28:03,@Shawhelp Is Shaw going to be offering any gigabit modems any time soon that don't have the buggy #puma6 chip?

2017-06-11 15:47:56,@Shawhelp is there an Internet outage in penticton bc? Haven't had connection for an hour or so.
2017-06-11 15:34:18,I ran a speedtest & it seems normal after all. Let's leave it for now. Thanks for the follow-up!
2017-06-11 15:26:58,FYI: My internet is back on. My wife informs me it came back sometime in the early afternoon.
2017-06-11 14:26:35,"Since your update page doesn't say anything about waiting for replacement equip, I assumed you might know more. Guess not. Thanks anyways."
2017-06-11 14:05:40,"Where is the ""replacement equipment"" coming from? This outage hasn't been a major disruption yet but it's still been a long wait..."
2017-06-11 13:52:48,So how long can you guys wait for bill payment to arrive then? After 5 hours this is ridiculous.
2017-06-11 13:48:29,"@Shawhelp I want an ETA on Vegreville services. Not ""in progress"". An actual ETA. Its been 5 hours."
2017-06-11 13:18:15,No issues until about 5 mins before my first tweet. And yes even direct connected the speeds are varying all over the place
2017-06-11 13:12:51,Also getting almost non existent upload speeds now.
2017-06-11 13:08:15,It's bouncing all over the place just got 2mbps directly connected. Doesn't seem like a constant speed
2017-06-11 13:00:21,It's working now but only around 100mbps not anywhere close to the 150+ we usually see
2017-06-11 12:50:23,Still nothing.
2017-06-11 12:48:46,Just doing a full reset

2017-06-05 07:51:21,I love @Shawhelp new WiFi modem. Except there is no WiFi. Profit by no service to customers but still charge them. Still paying for no WiFi.
2017-06-05 07:49:32,I love @Shawhelp new WiFi modem. Except there is no WiFi. Ask for a mail out and somehow it wasn't. 3 weeks now. Still paying for no WiFi.
2017-06-05 07:46:59,I love @Shawhelp new WiFi modem. Except there is no WiFi. Ask for a tech-that takes 3-4 weeks for one to appear. Still paying for no WiFi.

2017-06-04 11:15:18,@Shawhelp it looks like cable went down in Canossa Edmonton. Every tv channel dropped & the internet doesn't work either.
2017-06-04 08:31:18,Mornin. Is there a quick way to remove non-subscribed channels from the channel guide on the Arris gateway system? Thx

2017-06-03 22:58:29,Previous episodes recorded ok but these 3 not so much lol
2017-06-03 22:52:44,Does that indicate an issue with the gateway hard drive? Wierd that it was just those 3 specific shows
2017-06-03 22:45:20,So I can't watch my shows on my tv any more? I have to download an app and watch from my phone??
2017-06-03 22:41:44,Why doesn't shaw on demand let me watch anymore? The only options it gives me is cancel or add to wishlist. @Shawhelp
2017-06-03 22:41:02,There are other recordings with the green square but they play just fine
2017-06-03 22:40:14,Nothing. Just a blank screen.
2017-06-03 22:35:58,@Shawhelp I had 3 eps. of Handmaid's Tale on my gateway w/green squares beside them. None play. Does that square mean there's a problem?

2017-06-03 18:00:30,wondering if it's maybe the modem. This happens probably once a month since I got the riton modem. Stops for 15-60 minutes then ok
2017-06-03 17:57:23,my own router - but it actually just started working again. Any idea why that would have happened?
2017-06-03 17:53:19,@Shawhelp internet died here in new west about 15 minutes ago. Have cycled the modem and nothing. Any known issues in this area?

2017-06-01 19:57:23,@Shawhelp was skeptical about switching over from Sasktel but now I'd way rather spend the $300 a month to go back. This service is trash.
2017-06-01 19:55:22,@Shawhelp was supposed to have Internet installed at 1:00. Said it was too hot and they'd come back at 6. 8 o'clock and no one. Ridiculous.
2017-06-01 19:52:53,I'm getting notifications from the @BlueJays on my phone before they happen on TV. Good one Shaw @Shawhelp

2017-05-31 22:39:17,No. The Wi-Fi just cuts out. I'm all devices. You guys just switched out the router a few weeks ago. It's getting worse.
2017-05-31 22:37:34,Which is what you told me to do not long ago. Very frustrating. In the beginning you were good. Now just really bad.
2017-05-31 22:34:57,@Shawhelp your Wi-Fi is terrible. It keeps crapping out and losing its signal. Even tried switching router channels. Pretty annoying!

2017-05-30 22:45:52,I'd prefer to have stable internet over new services. I will be shopping around for exactly that.

2017-05-30 20:49:36,"Ya, but that is not even close to what you offer a new subscriber, they get the 150 and tv package with blue sky for like $5 more."

2017-05-28 16:48:40,@Shawhelp internet appears to be down in Gastown
2017-05-28 16:32:41,"@Shawhelp any reason why out satellite has been down all day in the Georgetown, On area? Rebooted it and still nothing"
2017-05-28 14:30:05,"@Shawhelp Hello, any idea when the outage in Coquitlam will be resolved? #goingovermydata"
2017-05-28 14:20:05,aight
2017-05-28 14:19:47,Thanks! Will do
2017-05-28 14:17:32,"@Bell_MTS your connection is horrible, switching to @Shawhelp ."
2017-05-28 14:13:57,"Wow. Just realizing how great @Shawhelp is, replying faster than anyone even though u don't have cell in BC. Great customer service. Thx"
2017-05-28 13:44:44,Fine what is the best price I can get on this connecting tho I am paying 75 currently that too limited data. If it's possible on this price.
2017-05-28 13:36:36,But why can't I get $49.99. What if I cancel the current connection and get the new connection. I just want that price for the Internet 150.
2017-05-28 13:25:48,Dear @Shawhelp why can't I choose internet 150 plan if I am existing customer of yours ? Better to switch to @TELUS . If I can't get $49.90
2017-05-28 13:18:30,This was happening to me so i switched providers lol
2017-05-28 13:17:12,Thanks @shawhelp we current have Shaw home/internet /cable we r having problems w our @Fidomobile Wish u had cellular >25 yr Shaw customer.
2017-05-28 13:01:10,I forgot password and Shaw sign in info. What can I do?
2017-05-28 12:52:44,I've reset device multiple times. Currently at Juan de Fuca Rec centre. New iPhone 7. Maybe service isn't installed on my phone properly?
2017-05-28 12:42:38,I have had this issue all over Victoria. ShawPasspoint won't work at all and ShawGo connects but doesn't give me internet.
2017-05-28 12:38:47,@Shawhelp my #shawgowifi connects but doesn't work #helpmeplease
2017-05-28 12:34:46,"Cool, thanks!"
2017-05-28 12:27:11,"Thanks, I have a feeling it's the PVR. I will call and talk to someone. Thank you!"
2017-05-28 11:46:13,"@Shawhelp Good Morning, is there an outage in SE Edmonton today? Cable is out and PVR recordings have been wiped"
2017-05-28 11:35:01,it's back on! Thank you!
2017-05-28 11:34:17,"I could do that with my current Gateway system. I'm sure Blue Sky is good, but I'm not happy losing features I had."
2017-05-28 11:31:22,Will do. Still doesn't solve the issue of apps not trusting your wifi
2017-05-28 11:30:31,@Shawhelp @ShawTVFortMc Are aware of any cable issues in dt Fort McMurray? My cable and Internet are down. Indy 500. Yikes yikes yikes!
2017-05-28 11:24:59,Ok. How do I do that?
2017-05-28 11:22:11,The apps work on other wifi & over the network. They don't trust the wifi. 4 browsing it's super slow. Logging into email takes over 1 min
2017-05-28 11:20:25,"Bottom line, it shouldn't have been launched until everything was ready. What does on the way mean? A year, two years?"
2017-05-28 11:18:44,There's nothing magical about Bluesky except you can talk to your remote. If you record sports then it is especially bad. Welcome to Comcast
2017-05-28 11:12:39,Some apps don't work. Internet slows right down. I end up turning off my wifi just so my phone can function.
2017-05-28 11:10:39,"I'm scheduled for Blue Sky install next weekend. Starting to think it's a mistake. No mobile app, recording options. Losing features."
2017-05-28 10:59:09,"As it turns out, I'm not the only person who has major issues with my iPhone every time it logs onto #ShawGoWifi @Shawhelp @ShawInfo #fail"
2017-05-28 10:13:39,"And I would love to switch to DSL, but Shaw has a monopoly in many areas."
2017-05-28 10:07:18,"Like I said, I did that. Not just once, not just here, but all over Western Canada. The problem is the same as airlines overbooking flights."
2017-05-28 10:03:08,"Tell you what, let's do this here in public. You owe it to your customers to have a reasonable explanation for years of unreliable service."
2017-05-28 09:53:38,Headed out the door - will try this afternoon
2017-05-28 09:53:03,I would like to change to a modem with no wireless features and to which I have the actual admin login. Is that an option I can pursue?
2017-05-28 09:52:08,"I have had a technician here already, and I have been through this a dozen times in different locations. Shaw Cable Internet is unreliable."
2017-05-28 09:50:38,Recordings ok on demand ok
2017-05-28 09:46:56,Says we need to subscribe. Even to basics we know we have
2017-05-28 09:46:43,"Desktop PC works (with Chrome). Don't have another Android phone here (but ""use desktop site"" does same thing. Firefox for Android works"
2017-05-28 09:41:48,@Shawhelp our blue sky won't let us watch any live channels! What should we do?
2017-05-28 09:39:48,I'll try another browser - force closing / clearing app cache doesn't help. Cursor moves in that text box but no text gets entered.
2017-05-28 09:35:42,"First of all, here is a post-reboot speed test. Good, expected speeds with very low latency. (I would use yours, but Adobe Flash, really?) pic.twitter.com/3KLj0zCEIj"

2017-05-28 08:39:52,So #sad it's the #last broadcast of the @CalgaryMarathon on @ShawTVCalgary after so many #years ! Hoping @Shawhelp stops the #cancellation !
2017-05-28 00:19:04,0 people at home using internet and @Shawhelp internet is not letting me stream on twitch. every 2 weeks this happens...
2017-05-27 23:34:07,@Shawhelp For some reason I can't enter my credit card expiry date in Chrome for Android when making a payment. Nothing appears.
2017-05-27 23:08:07,I'll have to try it out again later but I will keep you posted. Thanks
2017-05-27 23:07:05,I was using the account login not a Shaw email.
2017-05-27 23:06:09,night boys =]
2017-05-27 23:00:17,"Hey @Shawhelp , why did my box just do this?!? #seriously pic.twitter.com/93Y6Ppg4Fc"
2017-05-27 22:55:53,Which is odd because I used the combination to log in to the account (on a different phone) to remove the device
2017-05-27 22:55:07,So tired it in another Hotspot and the browser did open a log in page but I couldn't log in. Kept saying username or password was incorrect
2017-05-27 21:49:10,@Shawhelp is there an issue with internet in North Vancouver?
2017-05-27 21:46:24,"Bluesky TV is not as good as the old system. Sorry @Shawhelp , but not seeing just what I pay for is a huge issue."
2017-05-27 21:17:42,All clear through here. Back to Rocket League for me.
2017-05-27 21:10:25,Eyyyyy. I'm in SW Calgary.
2017-05-27 21:03:04,"@Shawhelp tv internet and phone lines down, anyone else having issues?"
2017-05-27 20:52:39,"Hello. Seems again I'm having an issue. Tried all troubleshootings and still US/blue , DS/green. No internet. Happens now few times a week."
2017-05-27 19:51:40,"Called in , the rep had no idea. I have zero internet connection"
2017-05-27 19:46:12,Yes ! Working internet connection would be great..
2017-05-27 19:42:26,"More than half the people I know with Shaw internet have these problems ongoing, especially after the recent high speed promotion."
2017-05-27 19:40:15,"You don't upgrade the infrastructure until after it has already been over subscribed, and a critical mass of complaints has been received."
2017-05-27 19:39:06,So disappointed w/ @ShawInfo @Shawhelp
2017-05-27 19:33:30,
2017-05-27 19:29:14,Are you located in Canada?
2017-05-27 19:27:40,Sure

2017-05-27 18:32:37,Tried going to a hot spot and the phone did not even detect it. I will check it out at another Hotspot later tonight

2017-05-27 13:45:59,It started after an Antivirus said Shawopen was unsafe. I've Uninstalled the app but the problem persist. I've tried removing the device
2017-05-27 13:44:12,@Shawhelp there has been issues with a device. It can connect to shawopen but has no Internet. Sometimes it connects then disappears.
2017-05-27 12:57:43,Looks like rebooting the router has fixed the issue. Thanks.

2017-05-25 13:45:14,do you know about Internet routing issues to/from sites in the US?
2017-05-25 13:34:07,@Shawhelp can the main news feed channels be changed from Detroit to Buffalo as this is closer to us?

2017-05-25 12:39:45,@Shawhelp Is there an outage in the Kildonan Place area? Haven't been online all day and cycled modem several times.
2017-05-25 12:18:54,@Shawhelp Internet and cable not working since Tuesday night in Victoria. Any outages there?
2017-05-25 11:27:12,Thanks. I'll let you know if anything changes on my end.
2017-05-25 11:22:15,Which makes remote backups near impossible.
2017-05-25 11:21:12,@Shawhelp how come I can't even watch my Pvr recordings while my service is down?
2017-05-25 11:20:54,Cool. ISPs in America are updating their lines to old neighborhoods. Also the upload speed for the highest Shaw business plan is painful.
2017-05-25 11:09:31,Wifi - I cant do a wired connection. Either way it sucks. Faster now but we go through this several times a day.
2017-05-25 11:05:22,http:// stackoverflow.com http:// semrush.com disqus (the commenting app) http:// thenextweb.com among others but hopefully that helps
2017-05-25 10:47:31,Yes
2017-05-25 10:45:30,@Shawhelp Certain websites aren't loading today at either work or home (both Shaw networks). They load when I turn off wifi and use data.

2017-05-23 21:48:33,It's horrible. Customers use to be always right.
2017-05-23 21:47:24,@TypicalGamer @samararedway It's not just @Shawhelp .. all across the board customer service has plummeted. They only see dollar signs.
2017-05-23 21:36:34,Hello Miss @Veronicaredway hope all is well. Can't wait to see the kids back live streaming they seem to be their most happiest
2017-05-23 21:24:24,Thanks for the update. Will bust out old school DVDs to fend off internet withdrawal...

2017-05-20 16:23:26,@Shawhelp how many times do I need to say no before you stop calling me about a home phone? Is 2x in 3 weeks not enough?

2017-05-20 11:48:36,Good day. Is Shaw open today?
2017-05-20 11:47:59,I check my speed weekly. You should always be getting at least what you're paying for. More is nice.
2017-05-20 11:47:20,Hmm. @Shawhelp would definitely know. I used to work there but missing 10mb could be connections outside or even the node.
2017-05-20 11:37:58,I haven't. Gina run a diagnostic in the router.
2017-05-20 11:32:06,According to my Shaw account I have high speed 25 which has. So I'm missing about 10mb/s download but one never noticed an issue. pic.twitter.com/vP1y1hz7SV
2017-05-20 11:16:36,Ok. Thanks. That's gives me something to look into.
2017-05-20 11:12:23,Now I have to figure out why my wifi is sucky. Possible banwith crowding?
2017-05-20 11:12:18,Ahh. And you're getting 15?
2017-05-20 11:11:21,"Originally yes, but I fixed that oops"

2017-05-18 13:44:38,@Shawhelp Your customer service is absolute trash. I cancelled my cable two weeks ago and I found out today I'm still paying it.

2017-05-17 19:07:33,I saw that Shaw truck! I was across the street waiting for a Telus tech that never showed up. Sigh.
2017-05-17 18:41:18,@Shawhelp will Shaw be updating their Gateway app for Apple??? Got a warning saying it will no work with future iOS updates
2017-05-17 18:30:06,@Shawhelp my shawgateway box power button is lit up red which I have never seen before and it's indicating no signal . Help!
2017-05-17 18:21:55,@Shawhelp maybe you guys should show the eastern conference finals instead of a May regular season Blue Jays game...just an idea
2017-05-17 18:16:38,Is a installer visit needed or can the customer pick up the modem and digital boxes at a retail access point?
2017-05-17 18:16:03,@Shawhelp How much notice is required to hook up a new internet service? The building is wired (has active 150Mb service)
2017-05-17 18:09:26,Come home to no internet and there are no @Shawhelp Tech's available until after the long weekend to help resolve this? Is this 2017?
2017-05-17 17:33:32,Oh I switched to Telus. Sick of shaw. Thanks anyway.
2017-05-17 16:48:12,"Not sure, but it's okay someone is coming to help me out soon! Thanks for the excellent customer service"

2017-05-17 16:34:29,it has not been a seamless transition to BlueSky. Even my billing info hasn't transferred properly (thanks to George for tipping me to that)
2017-05-17 16:25:07,and I have a dinner to get to. He said he'd check up on me tomorrow to see if the back end guys have gotten back to me.
2017-05-17 16:24:42,We've decided to call it a night while the back end guys figure out what's going on. George (your lovely on site tech) had other customers
2017-05-17 16:12:23,JB has been on it (check your DMs). Your tech and I have had a lovely 4 hours together even if it looks like there's no solution in sight.
2017-05-17 15:59:03,now appears we have multiple people at the backend on this. The on-site tech and I are trying very hard not to laugh at the absurdity
2017-05-17 15:34:59,I tried that already no joy
2017-05-17 15:31:10,"4 lights: power, send, receive, online on the modem. The router the internet light is flashing green"

2017-05-17 15:26:08,Multiple. Seems to be working at the moment but has been really inconsistent for weeks. Different locations.
2017-05-17 15:20:38,@Shawhelp is there problems with the servers again ?
2017-05-17 15:14:03,your tech is still on site waiting for a phone call from the back end. It'll get resolved but it is frustrating for all involved.
2017-05-17 15:08:37,and really annoying for the next customer who is already past their wait window.
2017-05-17 15:06:58,1st @Shawhelp dude didn't send up a ticket so me & the on-site tech waited almost an hour for nothing. More annoying for the tech than me
2017-05-17 14:51:39,"Not talking about paper bills.Talking about unsolicited ""Neighbour"" letters. I've got a boxful of them I'm thinking of sending back to you."

2017-05-17 14:14:27,Discovered that I can just ask Blue Sky for the exact time... Very handy when setting old clocks...
2017-05-17 14:14:18,@Shawhelp your internet service is awful. My internet comes and goes as it pleases and it annoys the hell out of me

2017-05-15 20:06:14,@Shawhelp is there an issue with shaw tv right now ?
2017-05-15 19:55:14,@Shawhelp Final invoice from Shaw. It looks like service kept going for an extra month after I had returned my equipment. Sleazy.
2017-05-15 18:28:51,"@Shawhelp just wondering if there are any reports from anyone in Richmond, BC with internet and cable issues? Mine says I'm not subscribed?"
2017-05-15 17:55:30,I think we got it working! I'll message if it stops again :) Thanks!
2017-05-15 17:49:02,Wifi. We are trying to reset it right now to see if it works. All of the lights were on which is why I'm confused as to why it wouldn't work
2017-05-15 17:48:35,@Shawhelp any updates on cable and Internet outage in Canterbury Park?
2017-05-15 17:42:15,@Shawhelp internet keeps disconnecting every few minutes.... nothing is working.
2017-05-15 17:20:32,"Then the attack must have been from another source, if that's the instance could I request and IP release please."

2017-05-15 14:13:16,@Shawhelp incredibly shoddy service from Shaw again. Internet sound have moved on May 12. Now they can't get a tech to me until May 24.
2017-05-15 14:06:48,I had the same problem. Tip: I have settings to record new and repeats so I luckily caught a later showing that was clear.
2017-05-15 13:56:40,@Shawhelp so much for taking care of new customers..... terrible first impression with you guys. Thanks for nothing

2017-05-13 09:37:59,No. And I don't buy that the signal doesn't look good. The upload is absolute crap.

2017-05-12 15:37:58,"Cable TV seems glitchy right now, intermittently. I'm in Nanaimo and other channels are similar. Digital noise. Anyone else reporting?"

2017-05-12 14:40:35,@ShawInfo @Shawhelp get your shit together we pay for services we only have half the time
2017-05-12 14:38:14,"I will swap it and let you know early PM. But seems odd that it is not working in 2 Devices at once. Nor on his Video Game, neither on my TV"
2017-05-12 14:36:16,How can I get it without being Shaw or Freedom mobile customer?
2017-05-12 14:31:35,"@Shawhelp Is there an outage in Redstone (CGY)? No phone, tv or internet!!"

2017-05-12 13:48:03,Shaw Direct
2017-05-12 13:45:45,"Well I sure hope you guys do something as your overall speeds, price, and data cap can match the Telus PureFibre offers out there."
2017-05-12 13:37:35,and it is only $85/month INTERNET only. Just saying.
2017-05-12 13:33:07,No the channel is not there. 536 is missing? Noticed 5-6 days ago.
2017-05-12 13:33:00,Hey #ShawCable (or @Shawhelp ) are you going to raise uploading speeds to combat Telus PureFibre (Fibre Optic) speeds of 150Mbs down AND UP.
2017-05-12 13:28:08,@Shawhelp did you move or remove Cartoon network?
2017-05-12 13:05:45,Ethernet conection hasn't been working in Cranston area last couple of nights. Aware of anything?
2017-05-12 13:02:03,"Both, getting 2 upload. Had a tech come out on Wednesday and switched the modem and have had multiple techs come out in the past."
2017-05-12 12:11:25,"@Shawhelp Our internet has been down for the 2nd day now, we're in the Deep Cove area of North Vancouver BC..."
2017-05-12 11:51:57,Why does #ShawOpen rarely work? Causes more frustration than it's worth! Totally Disappointing! @Shawhelp
2017-05-12 11:05:32,lol well played
2017-05-12 10:19:48,"Then yes, he's giving it away."
2017-05-12 10:18:52,Yes.
2017-05-12 10:18:02,"Is ""giving""the same as ""selling 49% for a really low price""?"
2017-05-12 10:17:31,I heard Brad Wall is giving half your internets away to his fat cat cronies anyways.
2017-05-12 10:16:57,It worked! Thank you!!
2017-05-12 10:12:53,"All the lights are on, nothing flashing. I'll try resetting the power :)"
2017-05-12 10:12:44,I'd say that's been your business plan for far too long!
2017-05-12 10:11:46,"Hang on, what if I told you that @SaskTel could match that price with less coverage and far slower service? Thoughts?"
2017-05-12 10:08:05,Hi! My wifi seems to be out. Is this a known issue right now?
2017-05-12 09:34:50,yeah the two blue ones are blinking all the cables are tight
2017-05-12 09:31:20,"60$/month for TV, phone, and internet 6X FASTER than @SaskTel ? Thanks @Shawhelp ! Just switched over, for 3$ more a month."

2017-05-11 19:47:19,". @Shawhelp Why am I going to be charged $180 each month while I am out of the country, but unable to use your services? This isn't right."

2017-05-11 18:02:03,It was Deceitful. Poor customer support too on the phone. @CRTCeng please note this
2017-05-11 17:58:02,"Ugh, I guess I'll go outside to play then"
2017-05-11 17:57:39,Those of you thinking if getting @Shawhelp #shawbluesky - Shaw will bill you double and not tell you to pay in advance. Be wary of them.
2017-05-11 17:51:12,That's exactly where I'm at
2017-05-11 17:47:39,"@Shawhelp what the f Yo? Internet down, send help"

2017-05-10 20:10:04,@Shawhelp my wifi keeps going in and out! Any issues in Port Moody??
2017-05-10 20:03:20,@Shawhelp if I watch a tv show on demand why can't I fast forward some of them?? It's really annoying.
2017-05-10 19:51:08,I've already had the modem replaced 3 weeks ago as well just in case that would help
2017-05-10 19:50:27,"No unfortunately it's an issue with the line outside of the house, but service men were in last week and it's still not working"
2017-05-10 19:44:05,I hate being the person who whines on Twitter but this is so unbelievably frustrating I just want to work.
2017-05-10 19:43:32,Internet is down completely and it's the same issue I had before and no @Shawhelp tech can come for 2 weeks. Again.
2017-05-10 18:39:02,"Nope, nothing. Both cellphone and desktop can recognize the network but neither can get internet"
2017-05-10 18:31:56,Ethernet... plugged straight to tv. Wireless for iPads etc. Happening fairly frequently. Just restated and it's up again

2017-05-10 18:23:23,@Shawhelp internet has been down for a couple hours. Have unplugged/reset router plenty. Next steps?
2017-05-10 18:23:19,@Shawhelp send you a DM.
2017-05-10 18:13:48,@Shawhelp problem with our phone - no dial tone
2017-05-10 17:56:33,@Shawhelp almost a year after I canceled my service you finally send me my refund and it isn't even the right amount... #brutal
2017-05-10 17:41:57,I don't need any help. I just hope that you guys are tracking this kind of feedback.
2017-05-10 17:37:54,No. 1) someone could overhear it. 2) password hints are notoriously bad for security (so bad i'm not even sure what single link to send)
2017-05-10 17:31:01,I called customer service and then demanded I add a password.
2017-05-10 17:21:57,"@Shawhelp FYI, adding a password with a hint to your phone process is not adding any security."
2017-05-10 16:54:30,Sent you a long DM
2017-05-10 16:42:42,Back in business thanks for waving your magic wand!
2017-05-10 16:36:39,@Shawhelp we had a tech come out and get us a new modem but apparently that hasn't fixed the issue.
2017-05-10 16:36:22,"@Shawhelp hey Shaw, we are still having problems with random disconnections.This has been going on for 2+months now with no fix."

2017-05-10 15:54:06,@Shawhelp do you guys purposely make your wifi connection terrible so I'm forced to use my data?
2017-05-10 15:45:42,"I remember when #shawopen meant a reliable hotspot. Now it just plain sucks. Hey @Shawhelp , will we ever get it back? Shaw issues for weeks"

2017-05-09 22:11:51,yes I am meticulous about adding the extra time making sure the yellow square is there and then hitting close. Still glitches
2017-05-09 22:04:36,Wired seems to be ok
2017-05-09 22:02:42,Rebooting the router every 2 day sucks @Shawhelp
2017-05-09 22:02:14,Wifi Internet down again @Shawhelp . Already switched to a different frequency
2017-05-09 21:53:17,Hedge against this by also taping the programs immediately following the game. Tonight election coverage must've bumped the end of it on CBC
2017-05-09 21:52:46,This never used to happen when I was a single PVR. Now it's guaranteed the bigger the game the more likely it will screw up. Usually I

2017-05-09 21:46:17,Found it thank you!
2017-05-09 21:39:24,Don't set your PVR to watch the election results tonight.
2017-05-09 21:38:36,After watching the entire thing I missed the last two minutes and then what was apparently the most feeling overtime ever. Thanks shaw over
2017-05-09 21:37:55,I never watch the Super Bowl. I watched the last one and set it for extra time. It cut off with two minutes left in the regular game.

2017-05-09 21:33:32,Morning. It was there saying add 90 minutes. Gam just cut off. At 3 hours. Who won the Rangers send game please
2017-05-09 21:32:44,Gateway with three boxes off the main brain. This happens fairly frequently. I now double check for the yellow square. Which I did this...
2017-05-09 21:27:04,One has to wonder why @Shawhelp has an add-90-minutes recording option when it only works four out of five times. #endofhockeygamemissing

2017-05-09 20:35:14,"varies, sometimes 170D10U, sometimes 20D,0U due to ""packet loss"" or something like that?"

2017-05-09 19:56:55,Of course I'm seeking tech help; that's why I (fruitlessly) phoned earlier today and why now I am trying online; my acct is in your database
2017-05-09 19:51:48,"I understand, unfortunately there are not any."
2017-05-09 19:51:30,"No, there are not."
2017-05-09 19:47:04,Meaning wireless vs. wired internet? It is wireless.

2017-05-09 19:34:48,Yes! Bad decision for hockey fans!
2017-05-09 19:33:27,Bad excuse! The game will be over long before the polls close. Lousy decision guys!

2017-05-09 19:16:32,On @CBCVancouver 209 I'm getting news and weather. On @Sportsnet 223 I'm now getting the game. Why is @CBCVancouver not showing it?

2017-05-09 19:08:47,The game is NOT on my TV tonight! Why is that @CBCVancouver @cbcsports ? @Shawhelp
2017-05-09 19:04:44,@shawhelp are there any real humans on duty in #bcpoli ? I need some election-night tech help but phone help #s were useless earlier today

2017-05-07 07:57:34,What? Unlimited? I'm on the 150 plan and it is not unlimited. I've asked you before about this and you've told me that that's not an option

2017-05-05 20:36:31,"@Shawhelp Shaw on demand is choppy and slow since earlier this week, sometimes completely stops and turns off. ???"
2017-05-05 20:32:07,@Shawhelp how can I tell if there is a service outage in my area or if my cable box is just malfunctioning?
2017-05-05 20:25:19,"But those show only ""up to 15mbps"". Even your Internet 150 only has an upload of 15mbps. Nothing faster even in your business lineup?"
2017-05-05 19:39:08,That makes sense. Thank for checking
2017-05-05 19:22:35,Thanks!
2017-05-05 19:18:28,@Shawhelp can you still use the gateway apps to control bluesky tv?

2017-05-04 20:08:23,Thanks but once @shawhelp pushes a client to this point without explanation it's too late. It seems like a deceptive practice.

2017-05-04 16:08:26,Wired ethernet. It's back now but this is the second time I've noticed it this week. Shouldn't DNS be static?

2017-05-04 08:40:58,@Shawhelp what remote controller can you recommend for seniors. Control both the cable and tv without switching sources. Needs to be simple

2017-05-02 23:02:09,"Great, thanks!"
2017-05-02 22:43:17,Belkin. I think it is quite old. Could the age have anything to do with internet speed?
2017-05-02 22:41:18,"Then when I try troubleshooting, it always ends up being ""unplug and then replug"""
2017-05-02 22:40:39,"Okay I'll try that. If the problem occurs again though, what other options do I have? We've had this problem sporadically since last year."
2017-05-02 22:35:57,That caused the additional problems tonight. Had to disable that and go back to separate names and passwords. Then it worked.
2017-05-02 22:35:18,every other day**
2017-05-02 22:33:46,I believe it's a separate router. So far I have only done the unplug for 30 sec and plug back in.
2017-05-02 22:31:08,That's been my go-to solution for the past month and a half. It's really troublesome considering I unplug it everyday if not every day.

2017-05-02 08:47:30,Xbox is always hardlined (directly plugged in). It appears it may have actually just been a hiccup somewhere along the line.
2017-05-02 08:47:08,buuut u never went offline
2017-05-02 08:45:57,yup I always thought it was you guys but after research it's turns out Xbox and ps4 have bad download speeds
2017-05-02 08:44:54,First thing I did was power cycle the xbox. Then just in case I fully powered down the ps4 pic.twitter.com/k5jp3gvLdd
2017-05-02 08:41:44,have u tried upgrading to the S? or doing a power cycle?

2017-05-02 08:25:10,@Shawhelp I seem to be getting very little bandwidth atm. Xbox updates usually between 40-80mb/s I'm getting kb/s
2017-05-02 08:11:49,Never mind. I called the help desk at 05:45. Thanks anyway. Last night I was dropped without warning - not helpful.

2017-05-01 22:13:23,@Shawhelp If you were a restaurant you'd be out of business for selling burgets but not putting meat in them. Crooks. The lot of ya
2017-05-01 22:12:32,@Shawhelp why can't you guys keep your internet up? Pay you the most available and I get gsrbage service.

2017-05-01 21:03:38,Yep. Thx
2017-05-01 21:02:58,It was both. But it's been stable for about 10min now.

2017-05-01 20:57:56,I think it's okay for now. But it seems to occasionally cut out.
2017-05-01 20:56:51,"Thank you, submitted the request"
2017-05-01 20:56:18,Is this an issue? My internet has just crapped out. Fiancé said it happened earlier today too.
2017-05-01 20:55:58,"Thanks for replying! We've had a few days of spotty internet for a biz account. That requires phone support, right?"
2017-05-01 20:55:46,Internet

2017-05-01 17:24:28,@Shawhelp Super choppy reception in Saskatoon. Is this system wide or just my place?
2017-05-01 17:24:19,@Shawhelp downtown winnipeg reception terrible.

2017-05-01 16:37:54,"Big Brother Canada. (Asking for a friend, lol ok fine it's for me)."

2017-05-01 15:40:15,Getting really tired of the internet cutting in and out on @Shawhelp the internet is great.. when it works!
2017-05-01 15:40:07,nope
2017-05-01 15:30:11,@globalnews @globalnews your station is not showing any thing -what happened @Shawhelp it's blue black channel? No @YandR_CBS
2017-05-01 15:28:35,@Shawhelp good afternoon. Are there connection issues in Victoria? No internet for a couple of hours now.
2017-05-01 15:20:20,Already did that! Some channels work but some say I need to call to subscribe to the channels. Even though I know I have those channels
2017-05-01 15:10:28,None of the channels work!
2017-05-01 15:10:06,"Just black screen, but I can go to the menu"
2017-05-01 15:05:52,Cheers to our Cable Hall of Fame Cocktail Reception Sponsor @Shawhelp . Our guests enjoyed networking before dinner. #CableHOF pic.twitter.com/XIYAxk1xcI
2017-05-01 15:01:00,@Shawhelp Upgrade to shaw Blue TV now my currents tv does not work...
2017-05-01 15:00:49,Thanks! Back on. Restarted but phone seems to cause issues. Old modem?
2017-05-01 14:51:46,It works
2017-05-01 14:51:26,"Nope, up at the moment, apparently there are Shaw trucks working in the area though, so that would explain things. Thanks!"
2017-05-01 14:28:10,It's been intermittent today. Dead line at our house; busy signal at my parents. Apparently our TV & web was also briefly down too this pm.
2017-05-01 14:27:26,@Shawhelp can't seem to get our tv working
2017-05-01 14:14:27,@Shawhelp How much is SNWL on its lonesome?
2017-05-01 14:13:13,"@Shawhelp - Hi, is there an issue with the phone lines in East St Paul? Having problems at my home and I think my parents must be too..."
2017-05-01 12:58:32,modem I believe. Maybe it's my phone because my computer is working!
2017-05-01 12:51:00,"Them’s fightin’ words! No, seriously, to each their own I say."
2017-05-01 12:38:16,"Hi Lance, no. None of the office computers can since Friday from Outlook. Webmail and other INternet works ok."
2017-05-01 12:35:50,"(It SHOULD be encryption, so if it’s still alphabetical it’s an Apple bug.)"
2017-05-01 12:35:04,"Your network guys are probably already considering this, and hopefully will change the name if it’s still alphabetical."
2017-05-01 12:34:45,"Difficulty is Open and Passpoint should have same signal strength, so if tiebreakers is encryption we’re good. If it’s alphabetical… sucks."
2017-05-01 12:34:00,"It was a thing in old iOS, I think. Mac never did it that way. Hopefully fixed. :)"
2017-05-01 12:28:44,I think (not sure) the iPhone might use alphabetical order for which network to join. Silly if so.
2017-05-01 12:24:46,"That would cut me off of all Open and you still have limited rollout of Passpoint, right?"
2017-05-01 12:21:34,@Shawhelp Outgoing Shaw Business Email has been out since Friday. Outgoing server is http:// mail.shawbiz.ca and not replying to ping.
2017-05-01 12:21:06,I wouldn't mind speaking with someone. But I'm now 28 minutes in when I was told I was next up...should I expect someone soon?
2017-05-01 12:17:35,"Also, I’d love it if it preferred Passpoint (?) over Open. (I’m on iOS, if that matters.)"
2017-05-01 12:16:54,I often find ShawOpen networks with limited Internet connectivity. I’ll make a note of where next time. :)

2017-05-01 12:01:00,Any chance of your Open/Passpoint networks doing better diagnostics and maybe rebooting if they're shitty in the future?
2017-05-01 11:59:49,Bad @Shawhelp Wifi networks keep costing me money b/c I have to turn off wifi and forget to turn it back on when I get home.
2017-05-01 11:42:40,unplugged and plugged in modem and restarted my phone. Perhaps I will try unplugging again?
2017-05-01 11:37:27,@Shawhelp having issues with wifi in Airdrie AB...are there outages?
2017-05-01 11:09:24,"I'm going to wait a couple of days to see if it clears up, but I'll let you know."

2017-05-01 10:51:25,@Shawhelp just got a new phone and can't get onto shaw open wifi
2017-05-01 10:44:29,"Yes, reconnected now. Thanks!"
2017-05-01 10:42:34,I don't have access to IPv6 sites and services via my Shaw connection but rather have to use a third party. Shaw is missing this feature.
2017-05-01 10:39:09,"It's back on History, but only happens during the program; not during commercials. I think all other channels are clear."
2017-05-01 10:35:24,@Shawhelp is there another internet disruption today? No connection right now in Richmond BC. Pls advise.
2017-05-01 10:00:42,@Shawhelp Hi. I'd like to cancel the wwe network
2017-05-01 09:53:18,"All done, but before I did all the troubleshooting, I noticed it only happened during the program, not during commercials. No issues now."
2017-05-01 09:51:40,:) Will have to change ours. Haven't gotten around to it since new modem.
2017-05-01 09:48:55,okay got it. thanks again!

2017-05-01 09:43:33,How do you gauge interest for features like this?
2017-05-01 09:42:10,my roommate who is not here with me is actually going to set this up. can my roommate do this by chatting with one of your reps online?
2017-05-01 09:41:35,"Back now. Thank you. Haven't seen it completely blank before. We have a neighbour whose network is called ""Sparkle Pantues"". Always there"
2017-05-01 09:38:19,Now no network choices are coming up at all. Lol! I'll switch off data and try again in a minute.
2017-05-01 09:31:56,"on the website, i cant seem to find the month to month option for your internet 150.."
2017-05-01 09:25:30,Yes thank you. It has been definitely showing as connected.
2017-05-01 09:23:26,i was talking about internet only btw? everything you said still applies right?
2017-05-01 09:19:26,Will do.
2017-05-01 09:17:59,@Shawhelp Internet not loading. Is there an issue in Cochrane?
2017-05-01 09:15:04,Nothing is working via blue Sky's...vod just doesn't load at all
2017-05-01 09:12:23,"Actually, yes. Quite a few, all affected channels are HD"
2017-05-01 09:10:33,ok thank you very much again! appreciate it
2017-05-01 09:04:56,@Shawhelp Issues with History channel in Comox/Courtenay? Very pixelated. Ch 270
2017-05-01 09:00:47,@Shawhelp vod outage ?
2017-05-01 09:00:21,"okay, thank you very much! another question, do you offer self install kit delivery? so we wont have to ask your ppl to install it for us?"
2017-05-01 08:53:55,"sounds good, as long as we can switch from either internet 30 OR 150 WITHOUT any cancellation or extra fees?"
2017-05-01 08:48:11,"so basically, we can go month to month and transfer to student for both 30 and 150? your website says u have a promo $45 for 1st 3 mo for 30"
2017-05-01 08:33:51,@Shawhelp any progress on IPv6?
2017-05-01 08:33:18,"does this also work for internet 150? so we will pay promo price for 3 months, regular price for 1 month and then student price on the 5th?"
2017-05-01 08:22:09,is it possible to subscribe to internet 30 for 4 months and then switch to a student plan? with no cancellation fee or whatever?
2017-05-01 08:07:29,alright. how long are your contracts? can we cancel anytime?
2017-05-01 07:17:29,"@Shawhelp hi, are there any student promos in BC right now? & for internet 30 (internet only), how long will the contract be?"
2017-05-01 01:15:55,@Shawhelp hello??? Turn #saltspring #shaw back on
2017-04-30 23:04:09,@Shawhelp why is the TV always going so pixelated
2017-04-30 22:24:40,Back up and running..just needed some TLC. Thanks for your quick replies!!
2017-04-30 22:23:24,Neither of those I'm afraid.
2017-04-30 22:21:42,It's our WiFi. Have unplugged coax and power. Still getting same message
2017-04-30 22:18:52,Wifi
2017-04-30 22:18:45,"@Shawhelp are there any outages in the Cowichan Valley? We are getting messages that we're connected, but have no internet?"
2017-04-30 22:17:33,@Shawhelp are there currently fly any outages in the Cowichan Valley?
2017-04-30 22:14:04,We got Shaw cause of the promise of speed but it's been pretty bad the past month!!!
2017-04-30 22:13:07,It's both. When we stream music it's very spotty and cuts out a lot then just drops. It's been getting worse and worse since we signed up
2017-04-30 22:10:59,"I have done that, and it came back for a couple of mins. It now shows that "" you can't connect to the Shaw gateway"""
2017-04-30 22:10:15,Nope. Was working for about 1 minute then went downhill fast.
2017-04-30 22:09:44,Omg @Shawhelp why is my internet so bad!!!!!??!! Terrible connection these past weeks
2017-04-30 22:05:07,So far so good. I'll reply if it drops again.
2017-04-30 22:02:42,It is just the one tv
2017-04-30 22:00:39,@Shawhelp hey my cable box all of a sudden just stopped working. The guide says no shows and all that appears is Shaw across screen?
2017-04-30 22:00:37,it seems to be back up. Any intermittent probs in the area?
2017-04-30 21:58:14,nope. It's a shaw fancy modem.
2017-04-30 21:57:57,"Wired connection to router, stock ""Shaw Advanced WiFi Router/Modem."" A splitter IS in use but it was replaced less than a month ago."
2017-04-30 21:57:05,yes I have. Nothing.

2017-04-30 11:49:24,You're lucky. I've been with Shaw for over 20 years. Every time a tech required in last year minimum 5 day wait. Then no guarantee of fix.
2017-04-30 11:38:03,Haha in general. And something I can afford! Do you know how expensive flights to Paris are?!

2017-04-30 08:24:11,It's still unacceptable customers have to wait 5 days for an available technician. Shaw needs to do better here or risk losing customers
2017-04-30 08:19:30,@shawhelp any outages in southeast Winnipeg? My internet's been down since last night. Tried resetting router with no luck.
2017-04-30 08:17:46,When is shaw going to add freedom so i can add my cell to the bundle
2017-04-30 08:12:40,Dumb question: What's the square root of minus one? That should keep you busy.
2017-04-30 08:10:48,Why does it take 5 days to get a service call. How does signal strength go from fine to not strong enough to get signal to Gateway in 2 hrs?
2017-04-30 08:09:42,@Shawhelp can we get MLB Network?
2017-04-30 06:39:53,@Shawhelp our internet has been down since last night and our cable box is saying no ip... having any issues in the Haysboro area?

2017-04-27 20:28:55,I could imagine. It's all good. Thanks and have a great night.
2017-04-27 20:17:00,@Shawhelp Thanks for getting back to me. #sarcasm
2017-04-27 20:14:43,Holy I thought at first that map looked like trump launched nukes at us for more deflection trade wars!
2017-04-27 20:12:39,I actually just powered it off and on two times and it now works. Thank you for the help :)
2017-04-27 20:09:08,Okay so I'm online that way... I'll try and fix my 3rd party router now lol. Thanks for the assistance.
2017-04-27 20:08:25,- that doesn't work either:( Is it my 3rd party router?
2017-04-27 20:06:11,Just sent it
2017-04-27 20:00:15,@Shawhelp cable is back but the channels are in the wrong place and don't match to the guide. What's going on?
2017-04-27 19:55:55,I am so happy that I was able to survive the great @Shawhelp outage of 2017!!! pic.twitter.com/33UjQ0lK5d
2017-04-27 19:52:55,Would you like me to try connecting to a PC through an Ethernet cable from the Shaw modem?
2017-04-27 19:52:25,Yes.
2017-04-27 19:51:59,pic.twitter.com/UtNBDkjsrM
2017-04-27 19:51:05,If I'm connected to a power bar should I be unplugging just the one connected to the modem or everything entirely?
2017-04-27 19:48:47,"@Shawhelp only the 4 middle parts are lighted up, the ""1,2,3,4"" ones. What should I do?"
2017-04-27 19:48:30,"of course, shaw tech support is second to none. Thanks for the reply"
2017-04-27 19:48:00,About 5 mins I'd say.
2017-04-27 19:47:56,@Shawhelp my internet has been done all day. I tried restarting the modem but now it won't even power back on.
2017-04-27 19:47:29,"Tx, you too"
2017-04-27 19:46:00,I actually did that already. Doesn't seem to be working yet.
2017-04-27 19:45:11,I rebooted my HD box and is still the same
2017-04-27 19:43:07,Nope. I finally got through on the the phone. The system sabotaged my services when it came back up. Probably trumps fault.
2017-04-27 19:42:50,Got a consistent connection around 7:30; should be okay going forward.
2017-04-27 19:42:48,Anticipating some @Shawhelp news to learn why the system went down nationally today for a couple of hours.
2017-04-27 19:41:27,I tried several. Shows I started on my HD box I just went and checked my non HD box to see if they worked. Standard definition will no load.
2017-04-27 19:41:25,"Hasn't worked yet, heard I may have to wait up to 5 minutes once modem and router are up, so doing that now."
2017-04-27 19:39:47,It works!!! Back in business. Thanks!
2017-04-27 19:37:00,"If you guys need business phones, let us know. We can help you out at http://www. pacificnx.com"
2017-04-27 19:35:31,"- yes, is that likely the problem? I've reset it but we still can't connect."
2017-04-27 19:33:43,It rebooted after your episode no Internet and TV today
2017-04-27 19:33:24,Will try. I'll get back to you after.
2017-04-27 19:32:19,"On my none HD box I get a message "" This title is not currently available "" error number: 1004"
2017-04-27 19:29:03,"Yes, I've done everything to no avail"
2017-04-27 19:28:43,On my HD box
2017-04-27 19:28:26,No error message I select a program it loads to play but no program is there
2017-04-27 19:27:16,"Protip @Shawhelp : after a nationwide blackout, you probably shouldn't jump on the horn and ask ppl to sign up for more services."
2017-04-27 19:26:42,Yes.. But also separated them. Beginning to wonder if it's a billing issue. I will call to find out.. Thanks.
2017-04-27 19:26:23,I don't have internet...... So all services have not been restored
2017-04-27 19:25:04,"Thanks for weathering the storm, and of course for fixing the problem."

2017-04-27 19:18:38,@Shawhelp tell Shaw it's @EdmontonOilers playoffs. Need that pvr baby. Policy...only tech could swap. Lol ok. @TELUS next day installs tho
2017-04-27 19:16:54,@Shawhelp outage in Yka makes my box say NoIP. Shaw says 7 days till a tech can come. Against policy to let me swap it at retail... 1/2
2017-04-27 19:14:45,@Shawhelp My internet still hasn't come back. I have already tried unplugging power + coax cables. I have a third party router in use.
2017-04-27 19:12:58,I have heard that!
2017-04-27 19:10:36,"I just did. Still no internet service, but have phone."

2017-04-27 19:01:29,Not true certain areas r still out
2017-04-27 19:00:10,The phones aren't working either. At all
2017-04-27 18:58:09,@Shawhelp what caused the outage today?
2017-04-27 18:57:52,No. Just one router connected to computer. Smart tv is working
2017-04-27 18:53:49,All seems to be working now.
2017-04-27 18:44:07,Yes. I assume it is at the same time. Starting again with unplugging to watch everything
2017-04-27 18:42:55,@Shawhelp Why don't you guys unplug your modem and plug it back in? It works every time. #Shaw
2017-04-27 18:38:13,Unplugged everything. Still not working
2017-04-27 18:37:41,@Shawhelp very disappointed with your customer service. Please follow me so I can DM you my number for someone to call me.
2017-04-27 18:35:45,No internet at all
2017-04-27 18:35:24,Drops on Wi-Fi and the desktop I have directly plugged into the modem
2017-04-27 18:32:11,"Lights stay the same. Also, one of your trucks was out front of my building today. Possible this is an issue related to that? Just wondering"
2017-04-27 18:31:30,us neither.... Or settle debit or credit.
2017-04-27 18:31:10,Couldn't even take phone calls.
2017-04-27 18:30:44,@Shawhelp how long til internet service is up again?
2017-04-27 18:23:36,No luck
2017-04-27 18:19:51,Internet came back around 3pm SK time.
2017-04-27 18:18:12,"Uploading at what rate though? I dunno, I always see streamers on Twitter complaining about being throttled during broadcasts..."
2017-04-27 18:18:07,Appreciate the prompt fixes. Thanks!
2017-04-27 18:16:11,I unplugged & we're back up! Never so happy to watch Frozen on my AppleTV
2017-04-27 18:14:38,"Worked, thank you"

2017-04-27 18:13:33,By dark ages do you mean 1995?
2017-04-27 18:12:37,Yo @shawhelp it's 2017. Why do I still not have NFL Network HD. I pay extra for the channel!
2017-04-27 18:10:52,I did that. Unplugged everything and it stayed up less than ten minutes. Have to go out now. Any ideas what to try later?
2017-04-27 18:10:16,They go through a splitter I have tried all combinations!
2017-04-27 18:09:06,"Back! Tried a few ways, eventually unplugging coax while power was on, did the trick. No idea!"
2017-04-27 18:07:40,Wow my #internet is faster than ever. Thanks @Shawhelp . If only you could get me out of #yyz . Traveling @WestJet is like using dial-up.
2017-04-27 18:06:09,@Shawhelp town of Shaughnessy has no internet. Any idea when it will be back on?
2017-04-27 18:05:52,You need to contact @shawhelp
2017-04-27 18:05:46,Hey @Shawhelp can you check into this for her? :)
2017-04-27 18:05:32,"By swap out, you mean replace ?"
2017-04-27 18:05:27,I'm home and it's all working great! Guess I'm watching on @TSN_Sports 4 instead of @NFLNetwork tho cuz it isn't HD... #NFLDraft
2017-04-27 18:04:42,thanks @Shawhelp for failing so spectacularly this afternoon so we could quit work and have beers at Strangefellows

2017-04-27 18:02:05,"nothing. As stated prev, ethernet connection doesn't either. No connection available."
2017-04-27 17:58:56,"On my own accord, step was not suggested"
2017-04-27 17:58:28,Yes
2017-04-27 17:55:17,Yes !
2017-04-27 17:50:48,"Just one, only have one."

2017-04-27 17:45:42,Still down in South west Winnipeg.
2017-04-27 17:44:46,Shaw's press release says it was during one of their routine upgrades. Laying off 80 IT staff yesterday now seems ill-conceived.
2017-04-27 17:43:36,Shaw tvbox is having issues and the help line doesn't have a clue what's wrong. I work and have no time for daytime service @Shawhelp
2017-04-27 17:43:05,"Yup, many unheard requests is what it seems like."
2017-04-27 17:42:55,"@Shawhelp , if only @WestJet was as quick as your blazingly fast #internet service. I would be home surfing now. https:// twitter.com/markdawg/statu s/857725085737725953 …"

2017-04-27 17:40:22,@Shawhelp no connection still. Downtown YEG. Tried all troubleshooting steps multiple times; no dice.

2017-04-27 17:36:51,"Yes. One to modem, one to shaw canle box"
2017-04-27 17:35:17,"That didn't work. Alright well this sucks, clearly can't fix it on my end. When is the next date to get one of your technicians to come help"
2017-04-27 17:34:53,Seems to be going on all over Airdrie. Took my daughter for mani/pedi and couldn't pay! Had to go get cash

2017-04-27 17:05:26,@Shawhelp does Shaw Open utilize my business internet service to expand the network? Our office Internet is so sluggish around noon.

2017-04-27 15:43:00,I think it's just streamers that get throttled for high upload usage.. Normal users probably don't get affected by this
2017-04-27 15:42:42,Good luck. Hope you can share as much of the root cause and fix as possible when you're back above water.
2017-04-27 15:42:41,We are back up and running after 90 minutes @Shawhelp
2017-04-27 15:42:32,Indeed. I think a nationwide bill rebate is in order for this outage

2017-04-27 15:08:09,Telus would have billed you for the outage. it looks like it's coming back online.
2017-04-27 15:07:58,@Shawhelp This is a major #fuckup right now. I HAVE TO DO MY ACHOOL FROM HOME AND I HAVE A TEST TOMORROW. That wasn't supposed to be in caps
2017-04-27 15:07:52,"Thanks @Shawhelp , I may just have to find a more reliable ISP next time. This isn't what I pay you guys for."
2017-04-27 15:07:49,I would hope thy would.... but I'm sure people are tearing them apart because it's the person who picks up the phone fault.... #NoLoveForIT
2017-04-27 15:07:43,Anyone else find it funny that all the updates on the #internetouttage are only available online? #shaw #outtage @shawinfo @shawhelp

2017-04-27 15:05:55,Alberta bc and Manitoba seem to be the main complaints
2017-04-27 15:05:39,I read that the outage went nationwide! bc alberta and some ontario people.

2017-04-27 15:03:22,@shawhelp do you have an eta on when everything will be back up?
2017-04-27 15:03:22,Anyone know what the new deals for Telus are at the moment? When #Shaw loses the internet AND its own support phone line tis time 2 switch
2017-04-27 15:03:18,it's a nation wide outage probably a DDos attack going to be hours or tomorrow before anything is up running again
2017-04-27 15:03:12,Thanks Shaw you have disappointed us again. How are you gonna make this right for us who are paying for your services?
2017-04-27 15:03:02,@Shawhelp WHERE THE HELL DID YOU GO
2017-04-27 15:02:56,"As one who works in IT & knows what your team is going through right, I hope consumers are reasonable while on the phone with your staff."
2017-04-27 15:02:36,Out in Cochrane too
2017-04-27 15:02:32,The number of complaints I've seen on twitter about Comcast... Yikes.
2017-04-27 15:02:31,@Shawhelp They lay off 81 of their head IT techs and the next day nationwide shut down. Coincidence?
2017-04-27 15:02:25,Where can I send my bill for all the staff we are paying with no internet access ?
2017-04-27 15:02:25,FYI #shaw @Shawhelp internet back in Langley after 90 mins. Hopefully stays up. western and central Canada will survive... probably.
2017-04-27 15:02:24,Maybe you should try sweeping it away? Seemed to work for the ducks when they had a little flame problem @Shawhelp #haha
2017-04-27 15:02:17,It seems to be up again. But it took nearly 2 hours to fix?? Dunno if I should be using you internet service when I'm paying so much....
2017-04-27 15:02:17,It's working for me again. I'll save the suicide note to drafts.

2017-04-27 15:02:01,Looks like I'm back up again here in Sth. Edmonton. Thanks for working hard to restore our internet & cable. #shaw
2017-04-27 15:01:54,@Shawhelp I'm gonna need some recompense for this outtage. A fresh isp-related meme should suffice.
2017-04-27 15:01:50,Work harder ... over an hour and still no updates .... this is not the 1900's
2017-04-27 15:01:48,"@Shawhelp please fix your connection issues.. it affected my streaming today, and still not connecting"

2017-04-27 15:01:10,@Shawhelp so is the internet down all across Alberta? This shouldn't be happening for how much you charge us for internet #unhappy

2017-04-27 14:08:53,@Shawhelp change wifi channels & unplug my cnection 4 times a month. Your wifi 150 needs to come down in cost. It only works half the time.

2017-04-27 13:04:07,Flash is installed and current version. Works on Safari.

2017-04-27 10:45:00,-- this instruction helped. Since our newer component does not have a pinhole reset. The power button ploy reset the system.
2017-04-27 10:42:34,"Thank you for the encouragement and good attitude, ^TF!"
2017-04-27 10:42:00,Frustration level back to baseline. One of our five portals now working perfectly. Will only write back if the other four fail to connect!
2017-04-27 10:39:37,The 'gateway' we have does not resemble the 'gateway' pictured in our system. Frustration level ... rising. Oh well ...
2017-04-27 10:32:13,"Our 'Gateway' is HITRON CGNM-2250 ... it would help if you could direct me to the Shaw page that tells how to reset. So far, no pony."

2017-04-26 22:13:49,It's obviously easier to notice when the players are moving. It's kind of like a frame has been dropped.

2017-04-24 16:24:17,Part and parcel. I find cyclists have no regard. Guy drove into me at a stop sign last week. On a bike.
2017-04-24 15:41:29,"That was supposed to say ""super helpful"" - so much for autocorrect"
2017-04-24 15:39:20,"Read up on vision zero. It seeks to reduce all roads deaths, & allow for mistakes by all road users. @JaniceLukes has proposed wpg adopt."
2017-04-24 15:32:25,Come work in road construction / service work for a day and it's possible you could end up seeing both perspectives.
2017-04-24 15:27:44,Which is where the stress as a driver is. I have to live with it if I hit someone who isn't following rules.
2017-04-24 15:25:21,"This is not the first time a Shaw employee has been supervgrlpful, but Paul IL20 was exceptional."
2017-04-24 15:24:28,"@Shawhelp wanted to compliment Paul IL20 on chat today, he was extremely helpful. He went out of his way to actually phone me re: Ethernet"
2017-04-24 15:19:36,"That's great! Active transportation has tremendous health benefits, reduces wear and tear on infrastructure, and doesn't pollute the air :)"
2017-04-24 15:17:37,Cyclists don't drive thousand pound machines at high speed. Risks if bikes hurting others extremely small. Cars kill thousands every year.
2017-04-24 15:17:23,"thanks... might wish to consider vetting all the comments for racism, sexism and homerphobia"
2017-04-24 15:16:22,"Come do school zone safety audits with me, and you can witness vehicle compliance rate for stops and speed around schools. It's shocking."
2017-04-24 15:14:36,"Sorry didn't meant to be condescending. Just many folks assume sidewalk riding is safer, when it's actually much much more dangerous."
2017-04-24 15:04:32,First to reply and welcoming! DM has been sent
2017-04-24 14:53:39,"Safety and volume of traffic? How many vehicles pass vs bikes? But again, we still don't know if it was necessary to park there."
2017-04-24 14:53:12,"Hey, wouldn't want to make you take 30 steps around a Construction zone though....thats too much for you."
2017-04-24 14:52:30,"But the anti-cycling crowd goes by their own experience, and it mirrors mine. I love the idea of active transportation."
2017-04-24 14:52:00,Safety . Maybe if I yell it you will get it . SAFETY !!!!!!!!
2017-04-24 14:51:09,Cyclists.
2017-04-24 14:50:26,Could sit on hold for 45 minutes waiting for paperwork clearance to access manholes or Telcom property. FYI
2017-04-24 14:50:12,"It boils down to the large segment of idiots on bikes bobbing in and out of traffic, rolling through signs, disobeying lights"
2017-04-24 14:49:39,You are beyond ignorant.
2017-04-24 14:49:21,No.
2017-04-24 14:48:59,"Paths and side streets are a good start. I know there are responsible cyclists, you just don't see many of them."
2017-04-24 14:48:13,I don't need to look anything up.
2017-04-24 14:47:39,So where do cyclists belong then? Just curious. Sidewalk riding is illegal and 4-5 times more dangerous than on road. Look it up.
2017-04-24 14:47:31,"There's a reason for that, as well."
2017-04-24 14:46:48,"No one is forcing them onto the road. Dismount and walk around. If necessary, that's the safest path."
2017-04-24 14:45:41,And a recent move to our lovely city
2017-04-24 14:45:31,Is it just because you have a hate on for service vehicles?
2017-04-24 14:45:11,An ambulance being there poses the same safety risk.
2017-04-24 14:44:45,My experience is that cyclists don't belong on roads. Doesn't mean either of us are right.
2017-04-24 14:44:23,"I didn't see shaw own anything. And so what they were in their vehicle? Doesn't mean job was finished, or had even started."
2017-04-24 14:43:43,What if it was an ambulance?
2017-04-24 14:43:29,Broad strokes. That's like saying all cyclists disobey rules of the road so screw them! They shouldn't ride at all!
2017-04-24 14:42:14,"No, it isn't. It's about the best place to put a service vehicle during a call."
2017-04-24 14:41:47,Better alternative would have been to dismount and walk around. But you are way more interested in bike lane justice than safety
2017-04-24 14:41:33,"@Shawhelp I hate ""Bingy"" especially when I'm on hold for 40 mins and have to hear her 10 times. Why annoy your customers even more?"
2017-04-24 14:41:11,Apples and oranges dude. If this was a private vehicle parked it would be different. There is a distinct possibility they HAD to be there.
2017-04-24 14:40:17,This isn't about parking in a bike lane. This is about service vehicles and where they need to be. Different narrative.
2017-04-24 14:36:50,I already shared our happiness for his over & above attention but I guarantee he's your only employee who has quadruples.
2017-04-24 14:35:15,There are cones out.
2017-04-24 14:34:05,"If the work zone was on the path, they would protect their work zone . For both their safety and yours ."
2017-04-24 14:29:27,Scope of work. It's important here.
2017-04-24 14:28:51,"Sure, if it's a planned outage. With Shaw/Hydro/MTS there isn't always an opportunity to Pre-plan. Crews dispatched on the fly."
2017-04-24 14:27:59,You would have had to walk around the cones regardless if they were working on the path so what's your point?
2017-04-24 14:26:54,"If blocking the lane is necessary, then they can set up a detour just like the construction site did. It just takes a bit of planning ahead"
2017-04-24 14:26:53,We aren't talking broad scope. It was specific to this job. Today.
2017-04-24 14:26:35,Make sure you use all your hand signals and come to a complete stop at every stop sign. No roll throughs....
2017-04-24 14:26:29,"If they were able to park elsewhere, they should have. But that's not necessarily the case, and we don't know."
2017-04-24 14:25:54,"Except no one has all the information, so it's a bunch of finger pointing and Internet yelling."
2017-04-24 14:24:47,"I don't think this is anti-cycling. I agree that is a prominent sentiment, but I believe this is simply people needed to do a job."
2017-04-24 14:24:13,"If you hit the lights at a cross walk and the driver doesn't stop, do you step into traffic because it's your right of way?"
2017-04-24 14:23:12,City regs actually require Safe alternate route be provided to ped/cyclists/drivers. Can't block sidewalks w/o alternative route presented.
2017-04-24 14:21:41,"Jamie , uses some critical thinking and look at the big picture . The solution is so easy and obvious . Grow up ."
2017-04-24 14:21:31,"No. Our own personal safety is our own responsibility. If we can see a posing danger, it's up to us to be safe."
2017-04-24 14:20:42,This thread exemplifies how a little common sense could have prevented a massive waste of everyone's time . Walk around . Problem solved.
2017-04-24 14:19:51,That person is 7 people separated from the job site. They have no clue .
2017-04-24 14:19:27,Blocking any lane at any time is dangerous. Construction zones are dangerous. Onus on cyclist/pedestrian/driver to find safest alternative
2017-04-24 14:19:14,Yeah the message you get from a phone rep is always the most reliable. #sarcasm
2017-04-24 14:17:26,"Yeah, because I've done it . The exact same thing"
2017-04-24 14:17:20,"Not a mic drop moment, sitting on info like that is silly. Changes the tune. I'll take a screen shot of that DM."
2017-04-24 14:17:07,Same. If you don't get why blocking bike lanes in dangerous (not to mention illegal) then I don't know what else to say.
2017-04-24 14:15:30,"But didn't want to park on the street and ""block traffic"""
2017-04-24 14:15:23,Based on the trucks dispatched. Not all have that equipment on top.
2017-04-24 14:15:03,They said so in DM.
2017-04-24 14:14:27,How do we know they can do the job with vehicle on the street?
2017-04-24 14:13:39,"No, he's saying you don't walk/ride through construction/service work. You go around. Always."
2017-04-24 14:12:47,Do you know what the scope of the work being done was?
2017-04-24 14:12:09,No ladders out. Just two staff sitting in drivers seats looking down.
2017-04-24 14:11:54,How do you know that without knowing the scope of their work ?
2017-04-24 14:11:38,Open parking spots across the street at the time.
2017-04-24 14:11:18,You won't walk your bike on the sidewalk but want service vehicles to park there?
2017-04-24 14:11:03,"Potential for heavy tools dropping, ladders falling , people falling .....its just common sense."
2017-04-24 14:10:15,Sigh. You aren't capable of seeing the big picture at all are you ?
2017-04-24 14:10:14,Would you cycle under their ladders? Feels just as unsafe.
2017-04-24 14:09:51,"If they are using the equipment on their truck, I fail to see where else they could park and do the job."
2017-04-24 14:08:19,It's not illegal to dismount your bike and walk 30 steps down a sidewalk. Life is hard though .....
2017-04-24 14:07:34,"Shaw lost an employee a few years ago , in a Construction zone , in Winnipeg. #Fact"
2017-04-24 14:07:18,i sent one was it received?
2017-04-24 14:04:48,Anyone who would choose to ride into on coming traffic here is a complete fool . Period . Use the sidewalk. pic.twitter.com/Z3PxGSKrKx

2017-04-24 14:01:30,pic.twitter.com/nwTjMORXBh
2017-04-24 14:01:27,"Exactly. Almost every day people stop, park, sit in bike lane."
2017-04-24 13:59:55,"Besides missing the point entirely , there are also overhead lines ."
2017-04-24 13:58:33,Same options ......walk around .......its not that complicated !
2017-04-24 13:58:07,"So if he blocked it with cones , whatever would you have done??!?!?!?"
2017-04-24 13:57:26,Walk around. It's not that complicated but it's taken several tweets and you still don't get it
2017-04-24 13:57:13,That would have been helpful. We witnessed two other families ride onto road as well. Little consideration from them would have been helpful
2017-04-24 13:56:17,Ride this protected bike lane every day. No manhole.
2017-04-24 13:56:09,Or would you expect him to block off a warning zone so you k of there is danger?
2017-04-24 13:55:38,What if there was a manhole on the lane where he was parking and need to open it ? Would you want your kids to fall in ?
2017-04-24 13:55:28,"Apparently it has to be within a certain time period, and parking authority has to see vehicle first hand. they dispatch within 90 minutes."
2017-04-24 13:54:21,"Yes Jamie , you are more important than his family. We get it . You could have walked around , on a sidewalk and lost 30 seconds ."
2017-04-24 13:53:12,Talked with City already. No call received. They suggested calling 311 next time as this is illegal-they'd like to ticket blocking bike lane
2017-04-24 13:51:22,"Why not have van on road instead of children? You're missing the point. Blocking bike lanes happens all the time, and is illegal."
2017-04-24 13:51:00,So you aren't aware they have to phone for access first right ? And test gas detection equipment and safety gear .......
2017-04-24 13:50:32,So cyclists should ride on sidewalks? Check your laws for City first.
2017-04-24 13:49:49,I'm trying to be polite. But if you walked into oncoming traffic instead of walking on the sidewalk you shouldnt be on the road period .
2017-04-24 13:49:45,"Talked with @Shawhelp . They were very helpful, recognized risks to citizens by blocking bike paths, and are talking their staff."
2017-04-24 13:49:07,Seriously? Looks at the picture. If your first choice is to ride in to oncoming traffic when there's a wide open sidewalk I can't help you
2017-04-24 13:47:10,"We were families cycling, not walking. Bike lane for cycling. Riding on sidewalks in Winnipeg is illegal."
2017-04-24 13:46:28,"Our family, and two others forced into oncoming traffic. Guess we're less important than two men sitting in vans."
2017-04-24 13:46:26,Looks like there's a wide open sidewalk.....
2017-04-24 13:45:58,Why not walk around the other side?
2017-04-24 13:45:44,No work being conducted while we were there. Two staff sitting in vans looking down.
2017-04-24 13:45:03,They had two workers sitting in drivers seat looking down when we were there. No sign of a work zone. Just sitting.
2017-04-24 13:44:25,Do you know where his work zone was ? Maybe he was blocking a manhole he needed to access on the path so he could work safely .
2017-04-24 13:44:12,"My kids and I did that. Walking into oncoming vehicle traffic not ""safe"" as you say. Honked at while facing oncoming traffic."
2017-04-24 13:43:46,Yes. Much better if the service Guy gets hit by a car than to inconvenience you for 30 seconds .
2017-04-24 13:42:06,Easy solution would be to dismount and walk around . Everyone says safe right ?
2017-04-24 13:36:20,Wired. and only a usb mouse in my pc. Purchased new network cards just in case wired and wireless. The modem is 3 feet from my pc.
2017-04-24 13:36:09,That would depend on the work zone . Do you k of what zone they were working on or are you assuming ?
2017-04-24 13:35:06,A little comprising and understanding can go a long way .
2017-04-24 13:34:29,Service vehicles often park in a way as to protect themselves from poor drivers while working on busy streets .
2017-04-24 13:33:25,"Or you could have dismounted, walked around the vehicle and continued on your way. That way everyone can go home safe to their family."
2017-04-24 13:28:46,@Shawhelp Techs say my internet 150 is fine. Not worth the 110 a month that I still have to pay for something I don't have. pic.twitter.com/RrABlHrFht

2017-04-24 13:18:57,@Shawhelp Is there an internet outage in Airdrie? Ours is out in the community of Luxstone. Trying resetting the router already.
2017-04-24 13:14:28,Can you check & confirm if this parking job was acceptable according to your company vehicle policy?
2017-04-24 13:01:22,I suggest they park where it doesn’t break the law.
2017-04-24 13:00:52,Is it driver’s call or Shaw policy to blocking neighbourhood’s only bike lane instead of the street?
2017-04-24 12:14:39,I would like to see both vehicles ticketed and towed. Period.
2017-04-24 12:14:24,Both. I went through all the tech troubleshooting from your site. Speeds stuttering all over the map.

2017-04-24 11:45:29,@Shawhelp Internet issues in High River? My download speeds are a 1/100th of what they should be.
2017-04-24 11:45:11,If it is not a loading zone you don't get to use it as one. That is the issue on Assiniboine as people feel they can use it as one.
2017-04-24 11:43:09,Not that it will likely do a lot of good but I would call Shaw and complain.
2017-04-24 11:39:45,Been forced to leave my house off & on because the internet is as slow as molases & keeps cutting out. @Shawhelp whats going on? This sucks.
2017-04-24 11:39:14,@Shawhelp Mark in central Alberta consistently goes way above & way beyond in his role. Makes our business needs a priority.
2017-04-24 11:31:21,Agreed. They weren't even doing construction as far as I could tell. Working in a nearby building seems to be reason enough to block lane.
2017-04-24 11:30:46,All of them. No tv or internet
2017-04-24 11:30:01,Two @ShawTVWinnipeg trucks were the ones fully blocking protected bike lane on Sunday.
2017-04-24 11:29:01,the convention seems to be that if you block the bike lane somewhat close to the construction zone then it is OK
2017-04-24 11:27:24,Back in working order now. Thanks :)
2017-04-24 11:26:25,Ironic they set out the safety cones to protect themselves from traffic
2017-04-24 11:25:29,"I have lots of sympathy for loading zone proximity issues (working where I do, it's a frequent issue) but not for long term blockages!"

2017-04-24 11:06:04,"Yup, parking was indeed available on North side of street. Demonstrates the lack of respect for families on bikes that some companies have."
2017-04-24 11:03:29,Isn't there parking on the OTHER side of the street? Bad enough it's been blocked by construction zone since it was created.
2017-04-24 11:00:22,This is so common on Assiniboine. Any service/construction vehicle (taxis too) will almost always use the bike lane to stop or park
2017-04-24 10:48:12,check your dm

2017-04-24 09:23:51,The attitude that parking in a bike line is less bad than blocking the road beside it is the problem. This spot is particularly bad.

2017-04-23 21:05:24,I have to say that I am really disappointed by the quality of the signal in the few months I have had cable - will give it one more month..
2017-04-23 20:49:01,"Wired and wireless, been intermittent all afternoon still no connection. pic.twitter.com/YOY1LRrt2e"
2017-04-23 20:44:48,"@Shawhelp currently experiencing an outage, tried power cycling my equipment. No dice Help?"
2017-04-23 20:28:44,I have no idea what I did or didn't do but is working now at least so not going to touch it. Hope unplugging did not impact PVR recording?
2017-04-23 20:17:00,Now I have no picture on the tv at all! What the heck is going on.
2017-04-23 20:12:09,"If PVR button is red, do I need to press it again or will it turn blue on its own. #frustrated"
2017-04-23 19:57:48,Dear @Shawhelp Why why why is the signal always cutting out so that tv shows can't go 15 seconds without a hiccup! So #irritating ! #cable
2017-04-23 19:57:12,I connected directly to the shaw hitron modem. Here's what I got :( pic.twitter.com/1NSIdfZYKO
2017-04-23 19:28:58,Changing chnl isn't helping I'm afraid. On a wired connection it's about the same. Can you look into my account and see if there's an issue?
2017-04-23 19:19:47,pic.twitter.com/v8WJOEvsdZ
2017-04-23 19:17:25,Yeah I've tried that
2017-04-23 19:16:59,"Tried that, unfortunately no dice :("
2017-04-23 19:15:25,Ok thanks
2017-04-23 19:14:25,All of them (not standby)
2017-04-23 19:11:14,@Shawhelp No Internet downtown. Known issue?
2017-04-23 19:02:08,@Shawhelp Do u know if there is an app I can get that would have the tv listings for Blue Sky TV? The 1 I use now has the wrong channel #'s
2017-04-23 18:55:10,@Shawhelp so we go our Internet 150 on Friday and then this happened. #blazingfast pic.twitter.com/f3HouBfbZJ
2017-04-23 18:25:04,I'm on my acct and seem to be going around in circles in the website -.- can you help?
2017-04-23 18:20:45,@Shawhelp just wondering how to add Crave TV to my account?
2017-04-23 18:13:49,So I seem to be pretty close to my max speed which is fine. Just need to keep an eye on WiFi devices. Thanks for all your time.
2017-04-23 18:05:59,Can you tell me max speed for Shaw Nitro and proper DNS servers and search domains for Vancouver?
2017-04-23 18:04:26,I have re-powered everything and speeds stayed at 94 down and 6 up. Tried on all channels. Seems stable for now
2017-04-23 17:51:57,"Appreciate that, but parking here forced families cycling bike lane to ride into oncoming 1 way traffic. My 7 yr old wiped out on big curb."
2017-04-23 17:40:35,I turned off WiFi altogether and speed jumped from 58 to 94. Turned WiFi back on and speed stayed at 94. Still low though.
2017-04-23 17:37:09,"@Shawhelp two of your trucks fully blocked bike lane on Assiniboine Avenue this afternoon, forcing kids onto road. @cityofwinnipeg this ok? pic.twitter.com/5n4YRsxgO4"
2017-04-23 17:35:16,The other side is a bedroom closet.
2017-04-23 17:34:00,"Also, that's not a loose cable - it runs back into the floor. There's no end so it's looped through the hula hoop."
2017-04-23 17:32:27,The landlord was ok with cable being installed but are you saying that that's the proper way to run it??? It's literally a hole in the wall. pic.twitter.com/6CDyy4jIxN
2017-04-23 17:27:06,"Unless you refer to hula hoops as ""cable outlet covers"", I'm confused as to why you're confused. #shaw #Cable #FAIL #WTH"
2017-04-23 17:25:52,Cable running through a wall about 2' from the floor & through a hula hoop. I'll lose some of my damage deposit due to that random hole.
2017-04-23 17:19:18,Still doesn't explain why this keeps happening. It's happened several times before.
2017-04-23 17:14:33,"I have an SD digital box and no Shaw PVR. The SD digital box turned off, cutting the TV signal. That's why black was recorded."
2017-04-23 17:06:46,I am doing all these downloads on a hard wired connection. Does the WiFi still matter?
2017-04-23 17:03:33,No scheduled maintenance. The cable box was shut off after 1:30am Saturday morning. I discovered issue at 11pm Saturday. Many shows lost.
2017-04-23 16:59:32,"I haven't noticed, but I will check the next time it happens. Up/Download speeds are always way lower that they should be. TV pixelates too."
2017-04-23 16:56:47,@Shawhelp @shawmaybe the cable that is threw the holahoop.... i thinknyou guys owe @LisaBakerComedy a new holahoop hahahahaha
2017-04-23 16:52:46,@Shawhelp does anyone know why my Shaw Nitro is only getting 55 mb down and 5 mb up speeds? Sometimes it stops dead.
2017-04-23 16:46:05,Moving. Pulled out my daughter's dresser and found all these paper clips. @Shawhelp - see anything odd about this picture? pic.twitter.com/dHQxkkGM1U
2017-04-23 16:34:03,@Shawhelp can you tell me what Shaw account details to use in order to sign into sportsnet mobile?
2017-04-23 15:58:22,Ok thanks I'll just sit here waiting for your reply
2017-04-23 15:52:36,No just want to know why we have two of the same channels

2017-04-23 00:18:11,@Shawhelp http:// t.co links failing only on Shaw. Working fine on mobile.
2017-04-22 23:46:39,I’m fairly certain Shaw gets that data from elsewhere. Needs to be fixed with their data provider as well.
2017-04-22 23:00:47,@Shawhelp I'd do it asap. https:// twitter.com/april_waters/s tatus/855984261614247936 …

2017-04-22 21:49:15,"Ah this time I caught the message ""Retrieving updates"" before going to ""No signal"". Now we wait"
2017-04-22 21:42:30,"Makes sense. I'll try again. If by ""a while"" you mean ""years"", then yes"
2017-04-22 21:40:28,@Shawhelp Global on Demand for Blacklist Season 4 Ep 17 is only 34 minutes long. Should be 45. Is this Global issue or Shaw?

2017-04-22 20:57:27,"Not yet, but at least back into the main account panel. I'll reset email passwords when I get a minute."
2017-04-22 20:51:23,My wife reset the account data. Not sure why that step was needed. You all force a mandatory password reset recently?

2017-04-22 20:06:36,Admits not admires. Though they do admire themselves when they don't get caught...
2017-04-22 20:05:59,"All of them now that my kids admires to messing with the cords, lol. Thanks anyway!"
2017-04-22 19:58:47,@Shawhelp is there a reason why my internet isn't working?
2017-04-22 19:05:22,"Nah. Tired of ""closer looks"" turning into tech visits that turn into ""oh it's network congestion so you're SOL"". Like that's my problem."
2017-04-22 18:56:14,@Shawhelp Will be contacting my lawyer. Your upload speeds drop to a flat 1mbps after about 15 minutes of streaming. Consistently.
2017-04-22 18:56:06,I got it sorted out thanks but can't believe how much people have to pay for cable and internet and telephone
2017-04-22 17:49:39,@Shawhelp sent you a message
2017-04-22 16:55:19,"oh and it hasn't been sorted out in over a year, good luck finding it now."
2017-04-22 16:54:36,doesn't help that I am trying to make a living off of streaming while paying an internet company to take away my internet.
2017-04-22 16:48:43,My internet speeds are so low that this tweet might not even make it out... and all that @Shawhelp can do is wait until Thursday.
2017-04-22 16:23:25,Have at it
2017-04-22 16:12:57,"Multiple visits and some connection ""fixes"" from techs, fixed nothing."

2017-04-22 15:28:08,"Already tried that maybe 10 min ago, that's why I came to ask you after that didn't fix it."
2017-04-22 15:19:09,@Shawhelp appears internet dropped a short while ago... Any work going on south of downtown Calgary
2017-04-22 15:18:02,"How do we get the newer model? And is there a cost? If the router doesn't have the range we need, is there a way to boost that?"
2017-04-22 15:12:26,"Also, is there an additional charge for using the router?"
2017-04-22 15:01:32,"Within 3 minutes @Shawhelp responds, meanwhile nothing from @Telus @TELUSsupport and sitting on hold for 25mind and counting. #telus #fail https:// twitter.com/shawhelp/statu s/855888216611848193 …"

2017-04-22 14:49:35,That is correct - trying to decide whether to te lace it or switch to the Shaw modem. Has it got good range?
2017-04-22 14:48:52,@TELUS @TELUSsupport the internet has been down off and on since 0800 - anybody know how to get in touch with @Shawhelp to switch providers
2017-04-22 14:45:04,I have a Shaw modem but we use our own router. What is involved in switiching to the Shaw router?
2017-04-22 14:37:36,@Shawhelp can I ask some questions about Shaw routers?

2017-04-22 13:58:00,I think it would just create the same issue in the basement as it is now upstairs unfortunately
2017-04-22 13:51:16,@Shawhelp Wifi signal upstairs is very poor. Wondering if there's a wifi extender you recommend to work with your routers?

2017-04-19 09:35:02,@Shawhelp is there a specific reason for the last 2 days all the channels are choppy? already restarted the pvr 3 times- didn't fix
2017-04-19 08:50:41,@Shawhelp is there a way to tell when I’m scheduled for my install?

2017-04-19 01:32:37,Hey @Shawhelp Did you ever figure out why the TV's kept freezing on the South Island?
2017-04-18 23:35:33,"@Shawhelp hey shaw, why is my bill double what it should be? Im trying to figure it out and im so confused"
2017-04-18 23:19:13,I retract what I said. This is brutal Shaw. Just brutal. My channels were taking off with me being told. Now i cant get it back.
2017-04-18 22:59:12,Okay thank you! :)
2017-04-18 22:49:15,@Shawhelp are there any problems with wifi in Saskatoon or is it just me?
2017-04-18 22:48:47,@Shawhelp 8:35 showing of @ColbertLateShow (chan78 Global) got garbled (video & audio). >_<* Please don't screw up 11:34 showing on chan11.
2017-04-18 22:14:58,"Take me out of this convo, please"
2017-04-18 22:14:33,So you point me to what I have to do when its something that happens repeatedly. Maybe look at the infrastructure.
2017-04-18 22:14:30,Hey @TELUS please hurry up on bringing #Optic to Springbrook! I'm sick and tired of the shitty product from @Shawhelp #slowerthanaturtle
2017-04-18 22:11:03,Sorry rings hollow. Your attention to this is embarrassing.
2017-04-18 22:09:51,Just a thought but maybe the same thing that's been happening every game .
2017-04-18 22:08:38,Can you fix mine a Shaw paying customer before you fix Heathers a Telus paying customers?
2017-04-18 22:07:18,This is so funny
2017-04-18 22:05:01,"Ongoing repetitively. Complain. ""Fix"". Happens again. Repeat. Is what it is with no fix. And unplugging/plugging in isn't a fix"
2017-04-18 22:04:51,Maybe you should reply to your customer and not me.
2017-04-18 22:04:41,"Channel 224, Sportsnet Pacific, for starters. It has been glitching on my TV for a few days."
2017-04-18 22:03:48,Hey @Shawhelp Hmmmmm....... https:// twitter.com/newfiegirl9674 /status/854545595377139712 …
2017-04-18 22:03:06,@TELUS is replacing our modem this weekend AT NO CHARGE as well. Customer service is amazing!
2017-04-18 22:02:01,We had connection issues and @TELUS came and replaced all the cable through our whole house AT NO CHARGE.
2017-04-18 22:01:58,You don't know what channel the hockey game is on? 223
2017-04-18 21:59:41,Delay the inevitable ?
2017-04-18 21:58:52,Apparently @Shawhelp thinks all our connections are no good
2017-04-18 21:58:39,But did you turn it off and on again. #ShawHelp lol
2017-04-18 21:57:52,I mean your amazing. Like everyone complains and it's my connection? Oh the connection you put in by the way. HELLO @TELUS
2017-04-18 21:57:26,Rebooted both boxes & it seems fine. Other channels do not appear to be effected.
2017-04-18 21:55:36,Our feed is also freezing and glitching.
2017-04-18 21:54:55,I'd think you'd be thankful?
2017-04-18 21:54:45,No I won't try that. My TV and others watching on the Island have a feed that freezes. You fix it. I'm not going to a chat board
2017-04-18 21:53:09,@Shawhelp Global (Ch 11) keeps cutting out - black screen & no sound. What up it's ruining #NCIS ?!?!
2017-04-18 21:52:51,I would say it screws up my Bud Red Light but we don't score so I don't know.
2017-04-18 21:51:31,Yea I'm bitter. I now hate Randorf. Your Shark love in irritates the shit out of me
2017-04-18 21:51:29,Yep. It has been freezing and glitching for the past couple games. Not on any other channels. Just the hockey.
2017-04-18 21:50:39,Nope @Shawhelp sucks. Freezes every two minutes.
2017-04-18 21:49:23,Yours to?
2017-04-18 21:49:21,"We switched to @TELUS so awesome, would never switch back!!!"
2017-04-18 21:49:18,@Shawhelp food network HD and SD is super choppy. (no pun intended) Has been this way on and off for weeks.
2017-04-18 21:48:54,It's not frozen...that's just the #Oilers standing still.
2017-04-18 21:48:06,Just thinking the same thing.
2017-04-18 21:47:50,Probably from Mars the way it's freezing. @Shawhelp best fix it soon

2017-04-18 20:04:24,@Shawhelp is there a reason my sport net pacific is all choppy
2017-04-18 20:03:42,We have Shaw Direct ... it has been persistent but watching NBA playoffs you really see the lag between picture and sound

2017-04-18 19:41:21,@Shawhelp why is NBA tv still in standard definition?
2017-04-18 19:39:27,How much is it to subscribe to NBA tv for the month?
2017-04-18 19:20:57,"We get cityhd, globalhd, aptnhd...but not cbchd bc it isnt part of the package for fort mac. Foolish really"
2017-04-18 19:14:49,I'm complaining to deaf ears though. I should really be putting my effort into contacting the CRTC
2017-04-18 19:10:33,Yup...so you can purposely nickel and dime people! #gouge
2017-04-18 19:04:48,Ya? Does SN 360 come with the TSN/Sportsnet package? Or is that @Sportsnet fault like you suggested before?
2017-04-18 18:53:14,Yup. That's why my entire family dumped @Shawhelp for @telus several years ago. More HD and variety.
2017-04-18 18:51:43,My bill this month after tax $215.21
2017-04-18 18:50:52,2) all that and no SN 360!!! You guys are crooks!!!

2017-04-18 18:49:24,Stupid that if you live in Fort McMurray &have basic tv package with Shaw you don't get CBCHD. you live in YYCorYEG you do. #ymm @Shawhelp

2017-04-18 17:56:31,Who decides what channels I get with my service??? I believe that is Shaw...quit trying to mask this or I'll be phoning to cancel with you
2017-04-18 17:48:38,Way to pass the buck! YOU decide what channels are available and you split them up on purpose to screw people! Maybe I call Telus instead!
2017-04-18 17:34:44,@Shawhelp @Sportsnet why do I have to subscribe SN 360 to watch PIT- CBJ game? I already spend $200/mo with you crooks!!! #gouge

2017-04-16 09:11:50,https:// en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wynonna_E arp_(TV_series) … apparently season 1 was on a different channel originally. But it should be showing as first run on space no?
2017-04-16 09:06:47,Saturday was the season 1premier in Canada. We seem to be running behind to the US. It shouldn't be showing as a repeat.
2017-04-16 08:57:18,But that was supposed to be the premier. Why was it showing as a repeat? It should've recorded as a first run. Who sets that part up?
2017-04-16 08:56:29,Thanks.....Waiting for @Shawhelp to get back to me!! Cheers
2017-04-16 08:45:55,@Shawhelp Question.....Why am I being charged for @Rogers center ice when there no games on?? Cheers
2017-04-16 08:43:51,When we rewound it back to the start the info said repeat. Neither episode recorded. But we saw them thanks to being able to rewind.

2017-04-15 12:25:53,"TSN has MLS soccer on 4 of 5 channels and only has it actually on one. Formula 1 is showing in one, hickey on another."
2017-04-15 12:08:08,@Shawhelp is it Shaw or networks that are responsible for accurate guides. TSN is particularly brutal. No listing for formula1 but it's on
2017-04-15 11:57:50,@Shawhelp I have picture but no audio: I already tried disconnecting power and rebooting. It's not my TV because I tested Netflix & it works

2017-04-15 09:58:13,the same power bar that the tv and HT speakers are.
2017-04-15 09:52:05,"It sure has happened again, at least 4 times during this 1 hr show I’m watching right now."

2017-04-14 22:31:25,@Shawhelp is the CW channel available on your network?
2017-04-14 22:08:35,It's Sportsnet themselves. If it was a signal issue the logo would also disappear during the black screens. Audio glitches also.
2017-04-14 22:06:15,Not going to happen during an #Oilers playoff game.
2017-04-14 21:57:28,Thanks!!! Go Oilers!!!!!!
2017-04-14 21:55:05,Hasn't happened in a bit but It even jumped to an American feed.
2017-04-14 21:53:58,That's what I'm talking about. Keeps cutting out. Thanks for looking into it!!
2017-04-14 21:48:16,@Shawhelp the cutting in and out of the feed for the oilers is that you guys or @Sportsnet starting to get annoying
2017-04-14 21:47:52,@Shawhelp is it just me or is your feed of the oilers game blacking out?
2017-04-14 21:47:22,Hey @Shawhelp or @Sportsnet why does my #Oilers video feed keep going out? Don't lose audio though.
2017-04-14 21:44:44,"Hey @Shawhelp , what's with the ""hd"" feed for the #Oilers game? It's grainy and really quite bad. @sportsnet"
2017-04-14 21:43:35,The SNW logo still showed up in the bottom right corner... it's the channel.
2017-04-14 21:42:17,Laptop.....Sports360 & CBC Were In HD Earlier When I Was Watching Them!!!!
2017-04-14 21:41:25,Now video issues? Come on @Sportsnet @Shawhelp

2017-04-14 21:33:49,There is much time to get these issues sorted. And having to get a tech out 4-5 times a year for the same problem is getting old.
2017-04-14 21:31:57,Yes. We have had issues in the past and then things go well for a bit and now we are back to they were. It just stinks when you work allday
2017-04-14 21:28:48,We have.
2017-04-14 21:26:32,We are unable to stream anything for longer than a couple seconds at a time on Netflix or MLB tv. Hard wired or not both are dreadful
2017-04-14 21:16:59,@Shawhelp Your sales rep lied to me to make a sale and that a manager has not contacted me as requested makes me feel as if you don't care.
2017-04-14 21:16:15,Thank you.
2017-04-14 21:14:26,Can you please send an image of what the Coax cable looks like?

2017-04-14 21:07:26,No I can't because it is my in-laws tv and I don't want to mess with HDMI cable. Will just go to a pub. Don't worry about it.
2017-04-14 21:07:24,No Gateway...and all different models
2017-04-14 21:06:22,Mostly happens either just after 8:30pm for an hour or 2 or after 1am for 3-4hours. Very rare does it happen other times
2017-04-14 21:05:14,It happens on all TV's numerous times a week.

2017-04-13 14:30:38,@Shawhelp (3/3) You could use that call to learn how not to instil loyalty in a new customer.
2017-04-13 14:30:06,@Shawhelp (2/3) I shouldn't have to hang up on them when they call to set up an internet install.
2017-04-13 14:29:22,@Shawhelp (1/3) maybe you could tell your staff that they aren't telemarketers.
2017-04-13 14:22:40,I have a Motorola DCX 3400-M which I got from Shaw

2017-04-13 09:13:05,Funny - because pingplotter and WinMCP reports from MULTIPLE Sources tells the story otherwise (packet lost on devices identified as Shaw
2017-04-13 09:12:42,So it says everything is connected but when I actually try to load something it tells me to check my internet connection.

2017-04-13 02:03:58,@Shawhelp I'd appreciate if my internet didn't go down for hours after midnight. Costs me a lot of MMR that's hard to replace when you're me
2017-04-13 00:30:28,This happens to me all the time; even when hubby not using. @Shawhelp doesn't care EVERY time I phone in . Good luck @drtashatweets

2017-04-12 22:37:38,Yes thanks. Multiple times. My issue seems to be something more complicated. One single channel not coming through.
2017-04-12 22:35:56,MB and Sask were kicked out of the Alberta region and put in the Jets region when the Jets came back but that was 6 yrs ago now

2017-04-12 22:25:15,Edmonton vs San Jose on Sportsnet West HD and it's happening on the Minnesota vs St.Louis game on Sportsnet 360 HD
2017-04-12 22:24:45,Probably someone who gets a lot of complaints from Oiler/Flame fans & doesn't understand that there's no such thing as blackouts in playoffs
2017-04-12 22:24:32,Normal blackout rules don't apply during playoffs. All broadcasts are national.
2017-04-12 22:19:30,Nope
2017-04-12 22:17:56,Still keeps cutting out. Just goes black over and over again

2017-04-10 15:14:38,"Oh, I bet someone else set that up. They didn't tell me. Thank you!"
2017-04-10 15:07:51,"@Shawhelp again, same issue as I've been having for well over 2 weeks now still not resolved. Internet drops for no reason wireless/wired."
2017-04-10 14:40:05,"but.... that's what I mean, same channels we have now.... costs us $5 more a month, and for some reason then said we save $30/month?"
2017-04-10 14:33:01,"The issue I had was transferring my current cable, which is very simple. Cost $5 more - said I'd save $30/month... was really odd convo. :-/"
2017-04-10 14:22:09,Not to your support. @Shawhelp was sure quick to respond.
2017-04-10 14:13:52,Lovely sunshine early here in Victoria but the clouds are moving in again. Can I ask about that new Blue Sky service? What is it?
2017-04-10 13:56:14,Cheers ken! Appreciate all your help!
2017-04-10 13:49:28,Cool.. how would I go about swapping it? Go into office? We've had it for at least 6 years+
2017-04-10 13:33:29,Cheers. It would if my #shawrouter was a modern day one.. ok thanks.
2017-04-10 13:29:22,"Hi ken, so.. ? What do I do?"
2017-04-10 13:24:21,@Shawhelp cisco router has no wps button.. how do I connect a wifi extender?
2017-04-10 13:20:43,It's back online - there was a shawvan out front working on the overhead lines - internet is fine now. Thanks !
2017-04-10 13:20:08,@Shawhelp need the wps button.. cisco router to add wifi extender.. where's the button?!?

2017-04-10 10:15:06,"@Shawhelp Is there a way to turn off DVS permanently on my TV? Some channels, it will just be on randomly, and it's annoying."
2017-04-10 10:13:18,"Ok, DM with info sent."
2017-04-10 10:01:20,"Ok, after doing that now all the channels say 'Subscription Service-for ordering information, press Info'."
2017-04-10 09:57:41,Will do...
2017-04-10 09:54:18,Yes the one with the PVR.
2017-04-10 09:52:04,Did already. May I suggest that instead of running redundant programming on TSN channels 1 be dropped and FS1 be added? Or Fox Sports Racing
2017-04-10 09:51:33,"No just straight to wall, no splitter. Tv upstairs on basic HD box works with all my channels."
2017-04-10 09:45:55,Now every channel says Not Authorized..? (After I unplugged/replugged)
2017-04-10 09:41:14,Well wifi came back but cable tv just says 'This channel should be available soon' for about 10 min. I'll try reboot with unplug.
2017-04-10 09:39:27,apparently it's an area problem as I just spoke with my neighbour. do you happen to have an eta on when it'll be fixed?
2017-04-10 09:33:53,My cable and wifi have been down about 30 min but I'm in Surrey. I read the other service area alert for Coquitlam...
2017-04-10 09:28:01,No other services are affected. Thanks for the update!
2017-04-10 09:18:05,@Shawhelp Internet is down and power cycling my modem isn't helping. Are there ongoing problems in Coquitlam?
2017-04-10 08:45:58,@Shawhelp Given that other local cable providers are supplying Fox Sports 1 to their customers when is Shaw going to step up to the plate?
2017-04-10 08:22:08,no so far its just the phone / cable Internet that's down.
2017-04-10 08:12:37,@Shawhelp we don't have any cable or internet in Belcarra. When should we expect to have service again?

2017-04-09 21:28:56,one cable. Nothing has changed in any of the setup from 20 minutes ago when it worked fine
2017-04-09 21:22:28,I've power cycled and the bottom light just flashes constantly. Hitron modem. Only time it's done that before was an outage
2017-04-09 21:13:01,@Shawhelp internet died about 10 minutes ago here in new west. Is there an outage?
2017-04-09 21:07:41,"They did, we'll be in possession of a new modem tomorrow. Thanks though!"
2017-04-09 21:04:07,@ShawInfo @Shawhelp I want to complain about your terrible internet service but I don't even know if this will reach you cause it's so bad
2017-04-09 20:45:59,It's one direct cable! Though my dad is now on the phone with I believe a Shaw Help employee.
2017-04-09 20:42:57,Had to PVR Masters today as we finally saw the sun to do some yardwork. Cut off by @Shawhelp and had to see that @TheSergioGarcia came thru!

2017-04-09 20:01:46,@Shawhelp Are you having problems with your internet? Wifi hasn't been working for a few hours.
2017-04-09 20:00:58,This is for a bedroom tv. Android box is already set up. No room for that unfortunately. This restriction is not needed. :(
2017-04-09 19:42:35,@Shawhelp kinda sucks that i cannot use my android box to watch shaw freerange tv.not sure why you would have a rule against hdmi connection

2017-04-09 18:42:03,Uh... weekend? Shouldn't have to do that. Getting ready to cut the cord. No #Netflix issues via Telus wireless.
2017-04-09 18:41:08,"Strange, it's been working fine here up until the beginning of March or so. Think it could be anything else but a VPN problem?"
2017-04-09 18:40:00,"How can you have the signal okay in one room but not the other? I don't know either, but you do."
2017-04-09 18:36:59,20 years with no issues. Shouldn't have to miss work to resolve this. Blue Sky? Uh... no way.

2017-04-09 18:32:50,It`ll say ``searching for signal`but it never comes up. Hates SUPERGIRL. And the `no content`over the content? Every morning on CITY.
2017-04-09 18:31:38,"Seriously, I`m a 20 year customer, but wondering why. Now I`ve got signal but there`s a `no content`over top of it."

2017-04-09 16:52:48,Hadn’t happened before and nothing else on the power bar reacted.
2017-04-09 16:17:12,@Shawhelp my internet connection has been​ randomly dropping the entire day. I tried resetting the modem already

2017-04-09 14:44:55,I find that Google Chrome works the best when looking at the web interface of Shawmail.
2017-04-09 14:38:34,Sorry...TSN web page via desktop

2017-04-09 14:05:50,Still interested in the reply to my question as to why Shaw refuses to check the picture at the curb?
2017-04-09 14:04:36,Message sent. Let me know if you do not receive it
2017-04-09 14:02:02,@Shawhelp Can you check why our #shaw150 internet speed is consistently slow please? 45mb/s download speed for a game via Ethernet
2017-04-09 13:59:50,"Not sure, does Shaw offer Internet OR Tv but not both?"
2017-04-09 13:59:20,This problem came up when an internet tech came by. Now our tv is no good. Even he was shocked that it changed because of his work.
2017-04-09 13:57:10,It only makes sense to check picture at the curb. Again is there any reason why Shaw refuses to do so ??
2017-04-09 13:56:31,The stretched sd channels do not work and a good portion of the screen is gone. Not the same at other homes that we have visited
2017-04-09 13:55:47,"Two techs came by, neither checked picture at the curb. I cannot keep taking time off work for another to check inside the house"
2017-04-09 13:50:31,Is there any reason why Shaw refuses to check the picture at the curb? It would at least eliminate if the problem is internal or external !
2017-04-09 13:48:42,Sd
2017-04-09 13:48:30,It is all sad channels on both the gateways and the standalone pvr. Shaw has said they don't know how to fix it. We dont know where to turn
2017-04-09 13:37:43,Oops autocorrect. Hd good sd bad
2017-04-09 13:37:07,"He channels are full screen, so channels are horrible"
2017-04-09 13:36:40,Stretch is not okay because everyone looks short and fat. Also the picture degrades drastically on stretch
2017-04-09 13:35:34,No two technicians have already tried to correct that. Everyone agrees that it is in the delivery of the channels.Btw it is on all three tvs

2017-04-09 09:35:51,Goodmorning Tony. What happens when a person exceeds their internet plan's download limits? By over 30%? Does Shaw throttle upload/download
2017-04-09 08:29:15,"And the first thing they'll tell you to do is unplug the power to your router, wait a little bit and plug it back in again."
2017-04-09 08:25:28,I think direct to a wall outlet
2017-04-09 08:18:44,You bet. The only thing on fire at Shaw is the bridges to their customers....

2017-04-08 21:42:49,But that's the same thing you sent before...
2017-04-08 21:38:54,I wouldn't hold your breath. Read tonight's tweets about freezing and pixelation...happens daily....makes some channels unwatchable
2017-04-08 21:36:49,"If you have a torture fetish, @TELUS delivers. At least shaw will provide the services i paid for. Unlike @TELUS"

2017-04-08 21:23:45,@Shawhelp what's up with the cable again? Freezing and skipping...It's getting very frustrating to say the least
2017-04-08 21:22:39,@Shawhelp your ufc signal is breaking up.
2017-04-08 21:22:16,@Shawhelp - trying to watch the curling but the signal goes in and out. Is it me or TSN?
2017-04-08 21:21:33,"Crappy feed for me too, very choppy on 223"
2017-04-08 21:20:40,It's happening to a lot of us.

2017-04-08 21:19:25,"The tip helped, thanx!"
2017-04-08 21:18:58,@Shawhelp this hold is not helping me figure out why the hockey game is so choppy. #nothappy #dontmesswithmyhockey
2017-04-08 21:18:54,Happening in Burnaby for the last hour too.
2017-04-08 21:18:42,it sure is. Horrible right now.

2017-04-08 21:05:54,You have at least 7-8 other people (many in the YEG) complaining about the same issue...but yet it's still a problem on my end??
2017-04-08 21:05:06,Thx!
2017-04-08 21:04:12,#UFC210 is also freezing for me! Paid for HD and it looks like regular quality... and stops for time to time!
2017-04-08 21:01:52,That's not the issue - it's the signal on different groups of stations
2017-04-08 20:59:35,@Shawhelp - your feed is getting choppy here in Vancouver. The hockey game and the MLS soccer game.
2017-04-08 20:58:28,@Shawhelp why can't I even turn to @CBC for hockey night in Canada
2017-04-08 20:57:59,I've had showcase and food on today and audio interruptions happened on show. Pixel and full interruption on food. It's intermittent
2017-04-08 20:56:51,Wtf @Shawhelp Im paying 60 bux for UFC 210 and the feed is choppy at times
2017-04-08 20:52:25,keeps freezing right? Mine is. Super annoying.
2017-04-08 20:51:05,CBC is freezing up for me too on my Shaw gateway here in SW Edmonton
2017-04-08 20:51:02,Yep happening at crabby joes too. What's going on?
2017-04-08 20:51:01,@Shawhelp any reason why my Oilers feed on cbc keeps freezing off and on? #yeg
2017-04-08 20:48:06,@Shawhelp hey is there any BlueSky issues going on in the Victoria area? I've got a lot of pixilation and interruptions on my tv
2017-04-08 20:47:31,@Shawhelp what’s going on with your @hockeynight feed??
2017-04-08 20:47:30,"Can't tell if this is a @Shawhelp or an @CBC issue, but commercials, and more importantly, the game keeps freezing. Please do something!"
2017-04-08 20:47:25,Guy over the phone finally answered and fixed it remotely. Thanks though!

2017-04-08 20:07:41,@Shawhelp Calgary flames games supposed to be on 223 but showing Oilers?
2017-04-08 20:03:39,"However, only ten or so of my 30+ channels on FreeRange. No Seattle stations. No KNOW."
2017-04-08 20:03:35,Wifi
2017-04-08 19:59:38,Ok. I thought there might have been some sub-account procedure. Thanks. FreeRange performance is really solid (on 5GHz).
2017-04-08 19:47:39,"Hey @Shawhelp what's up with the slow internet in Windermere, Edmonton pic.twitter.com/FmZsoK77SE"

2017-04-08 19:39:13,See @TELUS This is what customer care looks like
2017-04-08 19:35:22,Is there a recommended procedure to give other family members access to FreeRange?
2017-04-08 19:24:00,"@Shawhelp #FreeRange is looking very good. When did CNN get added? When I last looked, was told CNN streaming not yet licensed."
2017-04-08 19:10:44,"@Shawhelp How fast can you install TV and Internet. @TELUS just left us in the dark, for no reason."
2017-04-08 18:10:20,Oh. You mean the support that disappears after 4pm pst on weekends. Yeah. NO
2017-04-08 18:08:08,See. All here international connections would not be able to see her
2017-04-08 17:58:02,So. Big question. My spouse desperately wants to keep her telus email address. Can you mirror it
2017-04-08 17:29:49,@City_tv Why is your HD broadcast of the @NHLJets game with on @Shawhelp always so dull and grey? Wish this game was on @TSNHockey
2017-04-08 16:55:49,@Shawhelp is there somewhere I can try out #blueskytv before I get it? Had the HD gateway box before and I hated it. Had to return it.

2017-04-08 08:40:31,The Limited TV on BlueSky does not seem to match the Limited package on traditional cable. Surely an oversight.
2017-04-08 08:37:45,I had tried clicking there. Found the problem. Click does not respond. My laptop has a touch screen. I have to touch that field.

2017-04-07 17:38:35,Ok- so is there a confirmed outage ? Or it's just possible- should I be seeking an alternate solution for my connection problems or wait?
2017-04-07 17:35:40,Looks like it has just reconnected ...fingers crossed
2017-04-07 17:35:02,@Shawhelp internet not working

2017-04-07 17:12:57,@Shawhelp hey- my internet just went kaplooey - not having any luck running diagnostics - are there outages right now ?
2017-04-07 17:10:39,"I've done all that, it seems to be stuck on PSLd now, but waiting to see if anything happens."
2017-04-07 17:09:50,awesome! Thanks for letting me know. I don't have to stay on hold anymore to ask.
2017-04-07 17:09:32,@Shawhelp hi I'm just letting you guys know that my shaw cable is down here in Coquitlam
2017-04-07 17:06:47,"@Shawhelp is internet down in Port Moody? It just cut off a few mins ago, and yes, I've unplugged my Arris box for 10 seconds and waited."
2017-04-07 16:59:40,"It says its restoring its network connections, has been about 30mins?"
2017-04-07 16:57:33,"@Shawhelp my shaw cable boxes ""shaw on demand"" just crashed and won't let me watch any shows on it?"
2017-04-07 16:54:09,Yep. Roku box 12 feet clear line of sight to the modem
2017-04-07 16:53:27,@Shawhelp Are you down in the Port Moody area right now?
2017-04-07 16:51:33,Three days or so at reduced speed. Haven't hit even 25% of bandwidth limit.
2017-04-07 16:50:21,Wireless. Speedtest app. Read 160 when we first upgraded three weeks ago. Checked it when Netflix and YouTube performance tanked.
2017-04-07 16:45:26,@Shawhelp Help! Internet 150 is more like Internet 23. Upgraded a m
2017-04-07 16:41:11,Not a problem at all! It just happened out of the blue so that makes sense!! Thanks again!
2017-04-07 16:35:35,Well played @Shawhelp . Clearly an @TELUS problem. Stand by for my call to change providers
2017-04-07 16:34:37,@Shawhelp just told me all their feeds are working. Goodbye @telus !!!
2017-04-07 16:30:49,@Shawhelp are your TSN feeds working?
2017-04-07 16:09:16,Thank you!!!!!!! You guys rock!!!
2017-04-07 15:58:33,I have dcx3510-m
2017-04-07 15:54:50,"Thanks, but it's working now. The Shaw outage was yesterday afternoon and was fixed by the evening."
2017-04-07 15:39:57,I had just the regular HD PVR boxes before this new package and never had this issue this often.
2017-04-07 15:39:14,"It's been an issue ever since I switched to these awful, laggy gateways because of the new cable/internet/home phone package I'm on."
2017-04-07 15:36:21,"It loses signal then I can't access any menus. So I power cycle and sometimes it finds signal right away, sometimes takes a while."
2017-04-07 15:35:23,It's not the tv prompting me it's an actual shaw cable pop up.
2017-04-07 15:28:57,Every couple hours. It gives me an option to enter standby mode or abort it and counts down
2017-04-07 15:25:28,"Spoke too fast last week, now the SAME masters broadcast is on 4 channels no #nascar qualifying - nothing @Shawhelp https:// twitter.com/bstutsky/statu s/848547162443075585 …"

2017-04-07 15:09:54,Send a DM to your account
2017-04-07 14:38:37,http:// t1.re /
2017-04-07 14:38:00,not streaming currently. But i will most likely be keeping it at 6k. Never going under 5k for quality reasons
2017-04-07 14:26:50,"Thanks! They snuck this feature in only a few weeks ago where you guys weren't even aware of, so, I'm not surprise of no other reports."
2017-04-07 14:22:33,60fps 6k bitrate 720. runs smooth af.. well until the other day at least. lots of fluctuation in the upstream
2017-04-07 14:19:38,That's okay... I'm really thinking this is a firmware bug than a machine problem. Just wanted to give y'all the heads up that it may be.
2017-04-07 14:19:34,Apparently my IP address is in BC but I'm in Alberta
2017-04-07 14:13:40,thats exactly what the health graph looks like i'm doing ffs lol.
2017-04-07 14:09:24,"Hi there again... Well, I tried that, and it still shuts off. Even double checked the settings and the tab reads ""never."" So there's a bug."
2017-04-07 13:34:49,@Shawhelp any outage in Richmond? Minoru area? Have reset modem already
2017-04-07 12:59:16,"Done. Still getting ""signal loss detected"" as the TV flickers in and out, but the internet speed is back. Nobody else reporting issues?"

2017-04-07 09:44:20,Is there a problem with TSN this morning I am only getting TSN 2 and 3
2017-04-07 09:13:17,I pay enough money to Shaw I am not paying more to watch our own city team
2017-04-07 09:08:49,"Thanks, will do!"
2017-04-07 09:03:40,For both wired and wireless
2017-04-07 08:59:56,@Shawhelp I have internet 150 but I am getting speeds in the 4Mbps all of a sudden. My upload speed hasn't changed though.
2017-04-07 08:37:57,darn. Okay thanks.
2017-04-07 06:55:28,"that’s great! But, as a SN1 subscriber @nhlflames are to be available on companion channel. SN360 is different tier."
2017-04-07 02:06:55,@Shawhelp can i get a link for the shaw tech updates. For new guide or dcx3510-m boxes
2017-04-07 00:14:59,@Shawhelp Hi I'm not sure what to do because I have internet 150 and my download speed is at 71 mbps. How do I make the internet go faster?
2017-04-06 23:10:26,@Shawhelp my apartment has coax to the smartpanel but only cat5 to the location where the tv is. Can your tv box work with this? (Telus can)
2017-04-06 23:02:31,"For all my complaining about Shaw, the bill is really my only beef. And @Shawhelp has always been fantastic."
2017-04-06 23:00:03,"sigh. And by the time this is all set up the game is over. Also, you're assuming I have a PC..."
2017-04-06 22:53:35,and apparently I need my shaw user name and password. I don't think I've ever known those.
2017-04-06 22:50:04,But then you could watch Connor McDavid instead and that's like a gift in itself...
2017-04-06 22:49:24,but I don't want to watch tv on my mobile. I don't want to hold my phone for hours. I should be able to watch my TV
2017-04-06 22:47:02,City and CBC...
2017-04-06 22:27:52,Done!
2017-04-06 22:07:56,No I sent you a DM
2017-04-06 22:07:29,What sort of offers? My current bill is RIDICULOUS. New customer offer is a third of what I pay.
2017-04-06 22:03:57,I sent you a DM about my IP address
2017-04-06 22:03:10,How can I check that for tv Apple TV
2017-04-06 21:58:00,Thanks. Will try that in the morning
2017-04-06 21:52:32,@Shawhelp alrighty. I'm just anxious to get off the horrendously slow Telus internet I'm having to share at the moment. haha
2017-04-06 21:50:23,Ok so why would the iPhone app work but not the tvOS app
2017-04-06 21:50:09,Yep. Exactly the same model
2017-04-06 21:46:04,Hello
2017-04-06 21:45:04,@Shawhelp why 'no content' on channel 13 or 26?
2017-04-06 21:43:53,"Uhhh wtf @ShawInfo ??? I recorded the penguins/devils game on centre ice, come home and it's rangers/islanders on the recording. @Shawhelp ?"
2017-04-06 21:42:24,It's using WiFi but still works on my iPhone but not Apple TV
2017-04-06 21:41:15,"@Shawhelp ""watch history"" is only enabled on one of our boxes and doesn't even show as an option on box 2. How can we enable it?"
2017-04-06 21:38:27,Why would it work on iPhone but not Apple TV and have you seen the photos
2017-04-06 21:36:44,Appreciate the responses. But both calls were for the same thing & it still doesn't answer my call tracking question. But hey $ is $ right?
2017-04-06 21:36:19,hey - when would I expect to hear back about an install date after the inspection guy today said it wouldn't be a problem?
2017-04-06 21:32:24,have you seen the photos
2017-04-06 21:30:50,"Is my name in your system more than once? Can you not track calls? You are a telecommunications company, no? #shaw"
2017-04-06 21:30:26,yes but I'm trying to watch it on my Apple TV I just sent photos

2017-04-06 21:28:40,from my iPhone pic.twitter.com/dSVQtD4N82
2017-04-06 21:26:02,Ok. Gotta go now. I'm balls deep in this episode of 100 Huntley Street. Maybe I've turned over a new leaf!
2017-04-06 21:24:13,But it works perfectly on my iPhone
2017-04-06 21:20:53,"Thanks, but I don't get that channel. Would be nice if one of the other two channels were showing the Flames game in Calgary."
2017-04-06 21:15:38,"Wait, is your job just to jerk us around until the game is over?"
2017-04-06 21:14:50,"@shawhelp how come the @NHLFlames game isn’t on 302? @EdmontonOilers on 3 channels, isn’t companion channel for other West teams."
2017-04-06 21:14:29,"I shouldn't need to be removed from call lists. As a customer I should be afforded common courtesy, shown respect, & not taken for granted"
2017-04-06 21:14:02,Love sitting down to watch the @NHLFlames and instead finding the Oilers on all the channels we get. @Shawhelp @Sportsnet
2017-04-06 21:14:00,"I've only missed two games because of this, so I don't think it's worth it. But I appreciate the help. And think it's neat I could sign up."

2017-04-06 21:13:13,That's you
2017-04-06 21:11:29,Call lists are fine. Call lists every two weeks are unacceptable. Or do you disagree?
2017-04-06 21:10:55,New issue can't view the @EdmontonOilers on Sportsnet Now tvOS app pic.twitter.com/ZMv0MHqIPK
2017-04-06 21:08:29,"I only have the Flames companion channel (302), Sportsnet West and Sportsnet 1. No 360 because the games are rarely on that channel."
2017-04-06 21:07:58,Thank you Riley. Exactly.
2017-04-06 21:06:54,No problem. I've been looking for a reason to cancel my cable for a while. I'll call tomorrow!
2017-04-06 21:06:01,"From that explanation (posted picture), shouldn't the Flames game show up on the companion channel 302?"
2017-04-06 21:01:20,Don't have 360. See asterisk below... pic.twitter.com/mPI837iVZf

2017-04-06 20:50:01,No they said they can't help because it's a third party app and I would need to contact my cable provider
2017-04-06 20:49:59,Making it easier and easier to decide to cancel my cable altogether @Shawhelp . What gives @Sportsnet ?

2017-04-06 19:18:26,Yup. I assume the line from outside is splitting with one going to my pvr and one going to my modem.
2017-04-06 19:14:35,Done. How long does it take for the online light to stay solid. Right now it seems to be stuck with the Send light flashing.

2017-04-06 12:05:50,I managed to figure it out thanks
2017-04-06 11:44:08,@Shawhelp is there a reason why my Internet150 is taking 5 minutes to load a webpage with nothing else running?
2017-04-06 11:37:06,Can I DM you?
2017-04-06 11:34:37,@Shawhelp so we're told all off Alberta is experiencing lack of internet access due to routing issues? Is this accurate still?
2017-04-06 11:26:04,Thank for the quick reply ...That is very helpful. I have some more questions who can help me?
2017-04-06 11:22:39,Running errands right now

2017-04-06 11:11:39,I've learned that the modem needs rebooting or it won't notice when Shaw has restored service.
2017-04-06 11:10:28,The top light has been solid. The next 2 leds (assuming TX & RX) are blinking (assuming No Carrier)... for the past 2-3 hours

2017-04-06 11:07:20,@Shawhelp Hi can you tell what my current plan is matched to your current plans? We have Personal TV + Extreme- internet seems very slow
2017-04-06 11:04:32,"From @Shawhelp Sorry, just confirmed with our support team they are aware of the issue, its been escalated on our end to get resolved."

2017-04-06 08:58:29,"I'll play around and see what I can figure out. I did throw around the option of a second internet account, but, I want to keep costs down"

2017-04-06 08:49:52,Oh.My plan was to move the modem to the basement to direct connect my Xbox and have the wifi extender upstairs.
2017-04-06 08:48:52,"using Safari on a Mac, but tried other browsers too, same result. Never had issues before last night"

2017-04-06 08:10:22,Looks like routing issues on your end
2017-04-06 08:09:21,Hi guys! Any idea how much longer the system will be down in #yeg summerside? Was to be back running at 6am but still on the fritz...

2017-04-06 08:01:54,@Shawhelp good morning! I'm looking to move my modem and wondering what the best process is. Do the modems need a dedicated line?
2017-04-06 07:53:12,"@Shawhelp @ShawInfo what's going on with the network today and last night? Sites timing out, VPN noworking. Use @TELUS and everything works?"
2017-04-06 07:47:47,@Shawhelp weird stuff happening. Able to log in to ecsd website from Mobile data but not from Shaw home internet

2017-04-05 20:32:37,I'll keep trying things. Happened last week too-all devices. Thanks tho'
2017-04-05 20:20:03,"@Shawhelp is there an interruption or issue in Port Coquitlam? Lost internet. Unplugged modem/router, no change."
2017-04-05 19:56:17,What the fuck
2017-04-05 19:54:09,Is there a app in the works to allow access to the DVR to set recordings for the blue sky gateway?
2017-04-05 19:43:42,"Yes, I do and results are similar... not that it matters. We've had issues like this for years."
2017-04-05 19:36:21,@Shawhelp rumour is that shaw tv will be broadcasting Friday and Saturday @WHLHurricanes games from Medicine Hat. Any truth to that?
2017-04-05 19:26:18,And here comes @Shaw with its weekly internet issues. Thank god I'm ONLY spending $200/mo for this bullshit @Shawhelp
2017-04-05 19:07:42,@Shawhelp what do I need to do to join the twitter support team. Your team is amazing! I'd love to be apart of it?
2017-04-05 18:44:26,sent
2017-04-05 18:33:48,so it turns out the one in the basement is the main box. Now what ?
2017-04-05 18:20:10,I will. But I have a bunch of friends in the are saying their internet is slow too. So it can't just be my house
2017-04-05 18:16:17,@Shawhelp https:// twitter.com/RecklessKelly7 7/status/849776872678227968 …
2017-04-05 18:14:42,Have solid lights and last one is blinking. Internet has been slow for days and just got really bad now. Surrey BC
2017-04-05 18:08:15,@Shawhelp I signed up for Shaw 150 in Sep and the rate was 55$ a month for 2 years. This month I got charged 100 dollars for the the plan?
2017-04-05 18:04:03,personal acct
2017-04-05 18:02:13,@Shawhelp just dm'd :)
2017-04-05 17:57:36,@shawhelp i see you guys have fave'd this post- any way you can assure I actually get my service?
2017-04-05 17:20:26,Agreed. Serious that shaw.ca customers are not getting emails from suppliers. One of the reasons I’m not a shaw fan
2017-04-05 16:55:25,Thanks but no interest. We're off the Cable habit and won't ever return. Far too expensive compared with substitutions.
2017-04-05 16:34:37,Any update? It's still not working. :(
2017-04-05 16:28:36,@shawhelp Hi! I would like to make a few changes to our TV package. Do I need to call to do that?
2017-04-05 16:15:59,"Ugh, @Shawhelp ""fixed"" my internet today. It's inconsistent at best. pic.twitter.com/gN5Lu6qqNm"
2017-04-05 15:58:13,"Residential, but the URL is private. Your call center team confirmed it doesn't resolve out of the shaw network"
2017-04-05 15:53:17,"Thanks Harvey...I unplugged the modem, computer, TV and grandma's life support. That did the trick."
2017-04-05 15:47:49,I ended up calling in since this is a more technical problem than twitter can handle
2017-04-05 15:47:16,Any word on what this alert is? I'm in Surrey too.
2017-04-05 15:29:42,K
2017-04-05 15:23:42,@Shawhelp I live in Surrey 144 and 64 area. Internet not working. Has something gone down ?
2017-04-05 15:20:31,"It's only one tv . My tv is 43"" #4K pic.twitter.com/9KsbpqPx54"
2017-04-05 15:14:45,However people in #yeg that I work with who use your competitor have no issues accessing same site/connection in same method
2017-04-05 15:13:27,Unable to resolve connection to certain websites (timeout). Other Shaw users I work w/ have the same problem = 0 productivity
2017-04-05 15:03:33,When watching @Canucks on channel 22 the picture is so low quality I see Shadows on the screen then I switch to different channel & it's ok
2017-04-05 14:54:28,that is correct. We never go down there so makes sense to move it. Will i need to reroute anything at the junction box ?
2017-04-05 14:46:25,@Shawhelp is there an issue with internet connections in Sherwood Park area? Lost remote connection?
2017-04-05 14:46:22,"Dear @Shawhelp : can you guys please fix your channels for 1080p & 4k tv's, watching @canucks o @Sportsnet is horrible. Thanks."
2017-04-05 14:35:05,@Shawhelp your internet in #yeg seems to have some pretty serious connection issues ATM
2017-04-05 14:33:36,"@Shawhelp Hi, if I have 3 cable boxes but just bought a 4th TV can I simply move the basement one to the new TV ? Need to be Playoff Ready"
2017-04-05 14:24:43,@Shawhelp Why no internet in Prince George BC?
2017-04-05 13:47:17,any chance it can be included on the site so we know what's going on?
2017-04-05 13:44:12,I've done it but still being charged thank you
2017-04-05 13:41:04,I got it going after a while doing a hard reboot but it's irritating how often it happens & at the worst time too.
2017-04-05 13:32:41,Yes disconnect my services
2017-04-05 13:26:41,@shawhelp why won't you answer your dms unless i tweet you first? #ymm
2017-04-05 13:16:21,@Shawhelp why is Internet connection always so bad despite the $$$$ Shaw charges. Missing a live event b/c of bad signal.
2017-04-05 13:03:24,I hear ya!
2017-04-05 13:00:25,It really sucks when you're at work and missing a Oilers game
2017-04-05 12:58:31,That's the average wait time any I call @Shawhelp At least there's consistency
2017-04-05 12:53:00,"@Shawhelp phone, net and tv have gone out again at our house in Redcliff, nothing on the site. Planned or no?"
2017-04-05 12:27:26,I don't think content is the issue...not sure the equipment is 4K compatible at all.
2017-04-05 12:26:44,It is. Thanks!
2017-04-05 12:17:53,Hey Lance... now the slower (hi def) tv is about 5 seconds FASTER than the lowDef! I reset the LowDef one for no change. All OK!
2017-04-05 12:14:25,"restarted browser, pc, clear browser cache, cookies etc. The site works on data on my phone, wont work on wifi and wont work on my pc"
2017-04-05 11:59:05,2 b disconnected gave bd phone #but still being charged & shaw has a record of me calling but refusing disconnect because I will not verify
2017-04-05 11:58:23,Thank you for this. Too bad
2017-04-05 11:57:23,"Next day, still cant access http:// wowhead.com"
2017-04-05 11:57:08,But you don't ask everyone and why all of sudden me without any warning abit frustrating when you get laughed at anyhow I have asked twice
2017-04-05 11:42:13,K. I'll wait. Thank you
2017-04-05 11:38:03,@Shawhelp if we are in contract with 150 can we still sign up for Blue Sky as normal ?
2017-04-05 11:36:44,@Shawhelp so why the asking if drivers license...what's up with that can you give me a valid reason why
2017-04-05 11:26:48,Wireless?
2017-04-05 11:16:30,On a webinar Will do when I can. Thanks
2017-04-05 11:16:14,4K ????

2017-04-05 11:00:26,Done
2017-04-05 10:59:23,@Shawhelp How come there is an almost 3 minute lag between the Low Res TV in my kitchen vs the High Res in the living room being so slow?

2017-04-05 01:08:56,I'm asking them to reimburse my account for that time. You should do the same if you've been affected. @shawhelp #yeg #shaw
2017-04-05 01:08:13,"Also, last time this happened, they told me where I could sign up for notifications about outages. But no notification. @shawhelp #yeg #shaw"

2017-04-04 22:09:21,will try again in the AM.. But if you could make a note of it.. Perhaps an issue with Stingray feed to shaw?

2017-04-04 21:47:25,@Shawhelp any known issues with sportsnet 360 in Edmonton? Feed is all scrambled for me.
2017-04-04 21:43:09,I'm sure Douglas College will understand our internet is broken & because we live in #MapleRidge it takes weeks to get it fixed. @Shawhelp
2017-04-04 21:41:29,Got a student in college here who can't submit her work online as required. Can we get a note that our internet/Wi-Fi is broken? @Shawhelp
2017-04-04 21:40:26,Will check tomorrow - but Shaw Chat help was helpful tonight so I'm hopeful.

2017-04-04 21:22:24,See that nice big new TV? No cable for 3 weeks & now no internet fix.either. Staring at it doesn't make problem better. @Shawhelp pic.twitter.com/q5pjwtWaT2
2017-04-04 21:19:50,I've gone through this dozens of times. Nothing new and problem is the modem or too many on the node again. Quality of wired is awful too.
2017-04-04 21:18:13,We have no internet again and I'm almost at my limit for cell usage in one week. I have 3 weeks left on that and it's almost used up.
2017-04-04 21:15:50,No Wi-Fi or internet yet again. Thank you @Shawhelp Might just be time to get rid of it since it doesn't work. Tired of paying for nothing.
2017-04-04 21:04:36,@Shawhelp is there an issue logging into myaccount?

2017-04-04 20:05:30,I'd prefer not. I'd have to move a lot to a different floor to test. Plus it would still be going through at least one splitter right?

2017-04-01 14:29:21,@Shawhelp my bf's internet is trash. He still has Extreme...that doesnt even exist anymore...what can you guys do for him? This is silly

2017-04-01 14:08:20,You only see bufferbloat when your connection is loaded. Run a speed test that does: e.g. run http:// dslreports.com/speedtest
2017-04-01 13:43:14,Ping and Download are perfectly fine
2017-04-01 13:43:05,My upload speeds are way down that's the only thing different
2017-04-01 13:42:44,I only have a MacBook so that wouldn't be the issue I believe?
2017-04-01 13:26:36,I did try that as well. As well as power cycling my router and modem. And changing the DNS to googles.
2017-04-01 13:18:33,this only started after we replaced the modem. It may be an issue on Sonys side but was hoping to fix it before going to them.
2017-04-01 13:12:45,My internet has been running abnormally slow over the past little while. I've reset the box a lot and it hasn't worked any tips?
2017-04-01 12:47:43,I am using a router. I'm getting a large amount of network lag on just my PS4 and thought it may help.
2017-04-01 12:37:48,@Shawhelp is there anyway to plug my ps4 into the modem? Upgraded to 150 but my console won't connect to it.
2017-04-01 12:31:57,Thanks!!

2017-04-01 08:41:07,It did show me a generic error. But it would be nice if that message clarified it was the system and not my card that's was having issues
2017-04-01 06:16:03,Got that telus fiber optic line in your area?
2017-04-01 01:48:22,"If they don't reimburse, just leave. Honestly if you get bad connection and no refund then what's the point?"

2017-03-31 21:28:59,Maybe u could let us all know why no 1 from ur @TELUSsupport retention dept answers the phone. 3HRS on Hold @TELUS @Shawhelp @ShawInfo @Bell
2017-03-31 21:25:54,Still listed. Further proof that Shaw is not the least bit interested in what its customers have to say.
2017-03-31 21:20:53,Good to know. Followed but prefer to speak to someone regarding pricing and programming as it is too much to type. I will contact tmrw. Thks
2017-03-31 21:12:01,Unfortunately I need someone 2 pick up @TELUSsupport in order 2 cancel my services at 2 residences now. Ironic at the lack of communication
2017-03-31 21:03:27,Thank u @ShawInfo I will be in touch regarding ur pricing & programming. Obviously u value ur customers more than @TELUS 2HRS 45mins on hold pic.twitter.com/Wn8tdoj5Lt
2017-03-31 20:55:13,Filled it out probably 10 times over the past 5 years. Hasn't done a thing. You already offer spike too. Just not in hd.
2017-03-31 20:50:04,@Shawhelp quick question re bluesky: if I have 4 tvs how many portals do I actually need?
2017-03-31 20:39:47,No thanks!!! @Shawhelp here I come!!!!
2017-03-31 20:20:28,It's a 4k tv I know how to use it. I fixed it myself I just unplugged my box and rest it.

2017-03-31 18:20:38,No. Its a direct line. No splitter.
2017-03-31 18:14:56,Just one TV. Two others are working just fine.
2017-03-31 18:14:16,That would require shaw to admit something was wrong on their end and stop blaming the customers equipment #notgoingtohappen
2017-03-31 18:09:06,Tried as suggested. No change.
2017-03-31 18:06:32,@Shawhelp - you guys are really bad when it comes to customers movng our. Been with SHAW for 3 years. I am never going to take up shaw ever.
2017-03-31 18:03:04,Not sure but i have an anorid box that i watch it now so its all good

2017-03-31 17:33:21,You guys have to put in a formal complaint over this is BS @Shawhelp @Shaw @Sportsnet re: No Jays game

2017-03-31 17:27:47,"That fixed the problem, thanks"
2017-03-31 17:20:55,Yeah I saw that. I know it's not Shaw's fault. I've got those Snet channels but SD makes me shudder.
2017-03-31 17:19:48,@Shawhelp tennis on TSN2 is in SD while every other channel is still HD. Is there something I can do on my end or is this TSNs issue?
2017-03-31 17:18:17,"If I'm not mistaken that resets my wireless settings, correct? Password I mean"
2017-03-31 17:17:05,"OK, will try that."

2017-03-31 16:19:42,@Shawhelp It seems to be working but I was told to let shaw know that I have the new router so that they can do something on their end.

2017-03-31 13:10:13,Yeah weird I've tried everything. It's like the net is just down tries to connect and every time it gets to online it restarts

2017-03-31 06:51:06,I sit here shoving a toothpick in my box and tinkering for 30 minutes when it should be on the website. Now I have to reprogram my router
2017-03-31 06:48:04,@Shawhelp This is the second time where maintenance has happened without it being posted online. Even was potentially scheduled last time.
2017-03-31 06:47:00,@Shawhelp Why do I have to call support and request technical support before finding out about Saanich/Sidney outage? Why is it not online?
2017-03-31 01:26:53,@Shawhelp why is my internet down... uptime lately has been terrible.
2017-03-31 01:03:37,@Shawhelp is Shaw internet down in Kelowna?
2017-03-30 23:32:15,Direct wiring. Intermittent enough to disrupt the video (with long pauses) but not long enough for speedtest to detect the slowdown.
2017-03-30 23:29:14,You can catch up on Global on demand.
2017-03-30 23:16:03,@Shawhelp Kudos to your Brittney ID90 for her empathetic and skilled help in getting internet to my elderly parents home. She’s great.
2017-03-30 22:51:54,nope. ethernet cable

2017-03-30 22:33:53,Gaming. speed isnt slow but i would lose connection. I thought it was just the game but i would ping other servers and packet loss occurs
2017-03-30 22:32:53,Offline. Restarting router doesn't help. Same thing happened last night and night before that.
2017-03-30 22:28:36,@Shawhelp hey there. My internet's going down for hours last few nights (and right now). I am in Winnipeg. Is something wrong?

2017-03-30 19:15:17,Not to mention everyone is the Sault can't eat global . So it's not my box
2017-03-30 19:13:48,"That wouldn't help ! I have 200 channels, global is the only one not working"
2017-03-30 19:09:54,@CanadiensMTL @Shawhelp @Sportsnet you think you guys would promote your Canadian hockey games to your country. It's a joke.

2017-03-30 18:38:05,@Shawhelp if you're going to have someone call and interrupt my dinner can you please make sure that they can be understood in English.
2017-03-30 18:33:01,"The Shaw Service man , Jeff, deserves a medal for such GREAT SERVICE today ! All my services hooked up in no time and such a nice Person!"

2017-03-29 14:40:20,it's just come back on. Not sure what that was all about.
2017-03-29 14:39:15,@Shawhelp was wondering how to access shaw tv channel with free range tv?
2017-03-29 14:30:43,it's directly in the wall. I have checked connections and they are tight
2017-03-29 13:47:29,"it hasn't been updated in 2 YRS! Why would this be any different? Hey, support your existing customers with decent maintenance!!!"
2017-03-29 13:37:50,@Shawhelp Is Shaw going to update it's Go Gateway iOS app to be 64 bit? I get a warning msg saying it should be updated by the creator.
2017-03-29 13:28:38,I ask is because I missed episode 1 last night & @iTunes Canada doesn't even have it
2017-03-29 13:25:18,*done that twice
2017-03-29 13:24:57,yes I have down that twice.
2017-03-29 13:21:11,Turns out its actually working on most devices so its not a problem with my households wifi. Currently not working on my PC
2017-03-29 13:18:38,@Shawhelp is @ImaginaryMaryTV on Free Range TV pic.twitter.com/MavUlcZxRW
2017-03-29 13:15:18,seems to just be internet

2017-03-29 11:29:52,@Shawhelp Im currently experiencing some issues with internet connection in Alberta.Is this a known issue or is there a problem on my end?
2017-03-29 10:49:34,I'm following already:) I'll find my acct info and then DM
2017-03-29 10:45:01,. @Shawhelp 70+ days of not fixing the Internet. Real great customer service over there... #BadCustomerService
2017-03-29 10:44:11,. @ShawHelp sent a 'senior tech' to fix the Internet. He did not... This means I'll most likely get to meet a 6th person who works for Shaw. pic.twitter.com/E69cpjn5AK
2017-03-29 10:42:16,no just certain channels. The one I remember is the History channel(channel 243) theres also one or two more
2017-03-29 10:33:55,Thanks for getting back to me:) its skipping like a dvd would skip
2017-03-29 10:30:34,Thanks for the quick response! I'll head over to one of your stores. Have a great day!
2017-03-29 10:20:29,your phone agent hanging up on me because she doesn't understand the issue also doesn't help keep my business.
2017-03-29 10:18:01,The buttons are shot. New batteries didn't help the issue
2017-03-29 10:08:04,@Shawhelp where can I buy a new hdpvr portal remote? I'm in #yyc ! Thanks!
2017-03-29 10:07:13,"tech has been here, replaced modem, and told me I'm ""lucky"" to get over 40 on 2.4g. Your advertising should say that!"
2017-03-29 10:06:20,not acceptable
2017-03-29 10:06:14,your advertising is false if the most commonly used 2.4g band only gets 1/3 of the advertised rate on a GOOD day. This is typical. pic.twitter.com/VwDW6Gg5Ne
2017-03-29 10:04:37,5g has a much weaker range and Ethernet is only as good as the cord length and device support.
2017-03-29 10:04:30,@Shawhelp my time is off by about 4 minutes in my gateway box. It is currently 9:03 and my box is showing 8:59. How does it get synced back
2017-03-29 10:03:57,my most commonly used devices are not 5G and nothing in your ad or agreement limits 150 to 5G or Ethernet. Expect what I pay for!
2017-03-29 09:56:02,thank you! It has happened at least once a month. Is it normal?
2017-03-29 09:37:47,"@Shawhelp it's the Sahara here for internet. I've just got off the phone with Telus, internet will be at least a week sooner!"

2017-03-29 08:57:35,"I'm not looking for a solution, I am just showing others your service. too costly to change atm."
2017-03-29 08:56:48,"Why been through everything, last call told your rep to figure out a solution and call me...still waiting for that call."
2017-03-29 08:40:43,I've discussed everyday with one of your team. Still no date other than April 10th for internet to be restored to my home office.
2017-03-29 08:30:51,Today is day 3 without internet in my home office . Feels a lot like this... @Shawhelp where is the support? pic.twitter.com/QmIXMSt6Q3

2017-03-29 00:35:10,@Shawhelp This internet company is the worst I am watching @SOGAeon he has your internet and has had problems for months with no fix smh
2017-03-28 23:37:59,Constant signal loss. Never seen anything like it. Dogsitting so not at my own house but Shaw is crap.
2017-03-28 23:31:51,@Shawhelp #cnn reception problems. Both in HD and SD. All kinds of digital noise.
2017-03-28 23:17:38,@Shawhelp what is happening with TV reception... every channel in Calgary affected...

2017-03-28 23:06:48,"@Shawhelp why does this keep happening? Tonight, last night, last Saturday. Horrible picture and sound. Unwatchable. pic.twitter.com/usEryiT5si"
2017-03-28 23:05:02,"@Shawhelp I pay you for Internet 150, why am I being told it's normal to get no better than 1/3 that on 2.4g?? Why am I paying you for more?"
2017-03-28 23:05:01,"Tonight service degradation is beginning even earlier .... usually its not until midnight, but now at 10pm?"
2017-03-28 22:57:19,thanks. Have a great night.
2017-03-28 22:43:59,it's intermittent. Usually resolves if i go one channel up or down. This time had to unplug the box to get the picture back.
2017-03-28 22:32:18,@Shawhelp you guys are like the gift that keeps on giving. Got help frm 1 stellar rep. We learned a thing or 2 on this chat #mindblown
2017-03-28 22:22:09,Thank you. They were on a job in my building - not a great way to make an impression.
2017-03-28 22:16:21,when the tech was here for the power issue he mentioned the signal wasn't as good as expected and checked panel in closet.
2017-03-28 22:05:21,any idea why that happens? We just had a service call for power issue with this box not long ago. Is it a dud?
2017-03-28 22:04:16,"Thanks, you guys must be swamped. Was getting guide, no pic. Unplugged for last 20 and after boot sequence, seems ok!"
2017-03-28 21:54:21,it's a basic HD reviewer DCT model
2017-03-28 21:52:41,@Shawhelp been trying to connect to live assistance for ages. Keep getting to 4 second wait time and then bumped back to 4+minutes ?
2017-03-28 21:52:21,no. Basic had receiver no pvr in our house. Wouldn't upgrade to that since we have so much trouble already
2017-03-28 21:42:05,more than one and it goes all pixelated frequently too. Is that bad cable in the house or a bad feed into the house
2017-03-28 21:33:22,yes. This happens every second day. #nocanucksgameformetonight
2017-03-28 21:28:45,@Shawhelp I hope you get ref code: S0a00 whenever you change the channel too. My life sucks with this cable. #ishouldhaveswitched

2017-03-28 20:14:13,@Shawhelp we were watching season5 of Homeland on shaw on demand and it's no longer available. Was it on a channel that was free preview?

2017-03-28 19:42:11,@Shawhelp Are you experiencing delays tonight? Waiting a long time for a rep on the Chat function.
2017-03-28 19:30:18,"@Shawhelp can you please DM me. I have a concern on a facebook post on Facebook from a "" Shaw communications "" employee"

2017-03-28 19:15:03,. weekly tweet that i still cant stream hehe @Shawhelp
2017-03-28 19:14:54,communication error when trying to access
2017-03-28 19:13:09,I wish to watch a movie but Communication error
2017-03-28 19:12:57,It would say movies were on on other nights instead of the show that was actually on
2017-03-28 19:10:59,"tonight it says ""paid programming"" but should be ""Rebel"" @9pm & it has been doing this with different shows on different nights"
2017-03-28 19:09:33,Any @Shawhelp internet issues in #YYC ?
2017-03-28 19:09:04,@Shawhelp is VOD not working at the moment
2017-03-28 18:54:45,"last 2 weeks of the season, there should be no regional blackouts. #givethepeoplewhattheywant"
2017-03-28 18:54:24,@Shawhelp appreciate the response can/will anything be done?
2017-03-28 18:54:19,thanks
2017-03-28 18:47:30,@Shawhelp the Shawopen service is awesome. But the reception/service at goodlifefitness in Burnaby is non existent. Please upgrade
2017-03-28 18:39:11,@Shawhelp Cable and internet down in St.Albert. Any reason why?
2017-03-28 18:34:13,Enjoy the @Shawhelp freerange app but why would you NOT make your own broadcast available? So much for Rockets v. Blazers tonight
2017-03-28 18:32:00,It seems to me @Shawhelp has messed up a post and ought to have posted “ @DaBear67 [There] is some more” instead. ‘There’ is ‘their’ item.
2017-03-28 18:31:08,238 for sure. My PVR auto selected the hd channel when I select 13
2017-03-28 18:22:56,"@Shawhelp why am I not getting the Jets game on TSN3 tonight? The guide says it's on, but I'm seeing Sports Centre in Lorette MB"
2017-03-28 18:22:17,Running a home business relying on Shaw? Just 13 more days until we may get internet working again... Thanks for the support @Shawhelp pic.twitter.com/l5mzMFVOqt
2017-03-28 17:55:05,. @Shawhelp @ShawInfo Would be FANTASTIC if your FreeRangeTV iOS app was available on AppleTV. We don’t have a cable outlet in our bedrooms.
2017-03-28 17:55:01,@Shawhelp can't preset anything to record because the guide is wrong & it's really frustrating and I'm missing a ton of shows 2/2
2017-03-28 17:54:31,@Shawhelp every tv on demand title I click on tells me it is not available. Why is it on my menu if I I can't actually watch it?
2017-03-28 17:54:20,@Shawhelp killing me with this poor connection during this huge Leafs game and no service available until Saturday! #Shawproblems
2017-03-28 17:54:12,@Shawhelp it would be great if u actually had proper shows listed on the guide. For weeks BET (131) hasn't been listed right. 1/2
2017-03-28 17:38:06,@Shawhelp Hi! I wanted to watch the Jets game but for some reason TSN 3 is showing up a black screen for me? Everything else works though
2017-03-28 17:36:49,I just want to watch some leafs vs panthers
2017-03-28 17:34:59,@Shawhelp why is it that when I pay to watch hockey I am unable to due to regional blackouts????
2017-03-28 17:11:14,maybe switch to Telus?
2017-03-28 17:04:41,I can connected to my wifi but I can't use any online service.
2017-03-28 17:04:18,Also this is day 72 of @ShawHelp not fixing my internet.. #Update

2017-03-28 14:04:11,nothing I do will help. After a friend spend over 20 mins on hold she was told there is an outage in our area
2017-03-28 13:57:34,yes it is.
2017-03-28 13:56:30,I've unplugged the router several times too and I can't figure out what is wrong.
2017-03-28 13:56:07,everything. My internet is down and so is cable. When I called they said everything should be fine.
2017-03-28 13:48:08,@Shawhelp services are down for multiple people. When I called they said nothing was wrong.
2017-03-28 13:23:17,"yes I'd tried the power cycle. now have ticket #though call back led to ""oops, wrong team"" so the process has started again"

2017-03-28 10:01:39,"no, you set us up with what works for YOU. offerinservices you can't offer and then blaming me when I ask you to fulfill your word"
2017-03-28 09:59:41,Three calls later and 10:00 minutes and still on hold. Whatever happened to the Shaw call back service? Wasting cell minutes!

2017-03-28 01:47:14,I guess @Shawhelp has decided they get to choose what I watch after 1am. 2nd night in 4 that 90% of my channels are pixelating horribly.
2017-03-28 01:44:10,"@ShawInfo @Shawhelp YOU SUCK!!! Always doing ""maintenance"", always pixelating, always an excuse!!!"
2017-03-28 01:43:36,@Shawhelp why is it almost every night cable in Salmon Arm becomes unwatchable? Stupid paying for something that you can't use half the time
2017-03-28 01:42:01,@Shawhelp Haven't had wifi connection since 1300 today. WTF??? No wonder Telus has more subscribers!!
2017-03-28 01:36:10,so...can i expect a discount on my next bill considering all my hi def channels...twice this week are scrambled and unwatchable?!?
2017-03-28 01:33:17,@Shawhelp every channel keeps glitching and it sucks even the ads are messed up pic.twitter.com/8Nt4ajQvF4
2017-03-28 01:32:13,@Shawhelp your cable service sucks every night. So choppy can't even watch half the channels. What do we pay for. Canceling service...
2017-03-28 01:25:56,"@Shawhelp tired of this happening :( had a tech out months ago and it's back and has always been an issue.. ""fixed"" many many times pic.twitter.com/mIYQqtgnls"

2017-03-27 22:33:18,but this is the worst we've experienced it. Are you sure there are no signal problems in our area?
2017-03-27 22:33:02,"A lot of people in this community have been talking about how erratic the quality of the signal has become lately from Shaw due to overload,"
2017-03-27 22:32:08,"Don't have extra coax cables. Our internet comes in on the same line from Shaw, and it also has been wildly erratic today."
2017-03-27 22:30:54,"Only 1 TV. The husband is watching downstairs while I am communicating with you upstairs. He says it is ""focusing in & out"" as you & I chat."
2017-03-27 22:27:18,Also tried bypassing splitter. Also turned cable box power off and TV off and then both of them back on. Tried all of these things.
2017-03-27 22:26:21,"Yes! Tried resetting the box that brings the signal into the house by unplugging, waiting, plugging it back in. Also reseated coax cables."
2017-03-27 22:22:49,Hi EL. All channels.
2017-03-27 22:20:10,@Shawhelp Shaw TV in Pemberton BC is suddenly badly pixelated & out of focus. Normally excellent. Tried usual solutions. Problem in area?

2017-03-27 22:05:29,@Shawhelp The sound keeps cutting out on my pvr...It cuts out for a couple seconds and then comes back on and will do this often. Any help?!
2017-03-27 22:00:54,"the modem is separate, tv box is in another room"
2017-03-27 21:59:31,no there isnt
2017-03-27 21:59:14,"Internet only, tv is working fine"
2017-03-27 21:57:29,@Shawhelp is there a service outage in NE Edm?
2017-03-27 21:36:48,never mind it's working now . Had to restart my computer. Thanks for your help
2017-03-27 21:36:25,it didn't improve
2017-03-27 21:33:22,I've just done that but still no luck
2017-03-27 21:31:16,About to switch to Telus wifi because @Shawhelp is playing me tonight. Have to submit a paper and don't have wifi

2017-03-27 21:23:22,I'm in Coquitlam. Oh and it's been down for over 30 minutes
2017-03-27 21:22:55,"Plugged into the wall, tried other outlets -- still nothing I'm afraid."
2017-03-27 21:18:57,"Nothing it's completely black, has been now for almost an hour. Everything's plugged in, tv turns on but nothing else."
2017-03-27 21:18:42,not working on LAN either
2017-03-27 21:16:35,@Shawhelp my internet isn't working for whatever reason. What's going on?
2017-03-27 21:13:33,still going on/off. On Airport Extreme. internet light on the Airport Utility alternates from green to orange every few seconds
2017-03-27 21:11:39,i'm not sure. the basement people said their cable wasn't working
2017-03-27 21:11:36,"took one out for now, not using that PVR, and replaced the other with an inline connector."
2017-03-27 21:11:16,i have a router but i'm using the shaw modem. the router is just as slow on my computer
2017-03-27 21:07:32,wifi
2017-03-27 21:05:58,well it's slow and sometimes it doesn't even connect

2017-03-27 18:08:18,Can you beat @Shawhelp to get my home business connected to the internet again? They are booking April 10th fastest repair.
2017-03-27 17:54:24,@Shawhelp booking April 10th to repair zero internet for home business. @telus new customer set up faster? #vote your guess.and stay tuned.

2017-03-26 19:00:03,hmm...Usually the same channel...TLC I think. BTW often times it stutters when playing back recordings from other channels.

2017-03-25 20:55:17,what would cause only certain floors to be affected and not all of them ? We'll see if these steps can help
2017-03-25 20:52:24,"it's only on certain floors, not all guest rooms are affected"
2017-03-25 20:49:55,we're getting a no signal message on the screen

2017-03-25 20:41:50,we've been on hold with customer service for over an hour. @FairmontWF has no cable in many rooms not sure exactly what it is
2017-03-25 20:40:01,I need the business hotline. No one else has been able to assist.

2017-03-25 12:56:43,I call in and you guys tell me to drive an hour to pick up a splitter. Unacceptable I wish there was competition.
2017-03-25 12:55:37,@ShawInfo @Shawhelp I absolutely hate you guys. Take the weekend off the watch #hwc and I get non stop buffering on wide open 150.
2017-03-25 12:45:05,"oh, ok. Is there a charge? Thanks."
2017-03-25 12:36:50,"@Shawhelp for last month,all the buttons on remote I have to press hard to work.Changed batteries multi times and still same prob.any ideas?"

2017-03-25 01:57:02,Yes I've reset the router . Doesn't matter what time of day but It does get absolutely shittier after midnight
2017-03-25 01:53:56,Wifi . It's been very sketchy for about 2 weeks now. I'm wasting money on this shitty service. It's on all devices in the house not just one
2017-03-25 01:15:05,"@Shawhelp we have Internet outage since 6:30pm, any particular reason!"
2017-03-24 22:44:40,yes. 5G network. Which was billed as faster when I took the new modem.

2017-03-21 00:20:31,"I'm normally at 60, then it drops to usually much lower then 10 for 20min-1hour, then comes back. Frustrating."

2017-03-20 15:41:41,my internet is now good. Was root cause determined to be a shaw issue outside my house ? Or do I have a modem acting strange ?
2017-03-20 15:27:17,You should be scheduling these things together & @Shawhelp @TELUS should be giving local subscribers huge discount.
2017-03-20 15:02:29,Thanks. Sent you my account number
2017-03-20 14:53:57,@Shawhelp I was wondering if I can get an additional IP for my home service? We are allowed 2 but it needs to be requested? Thanks.

2017-03-20 14:31:34,and it's down again

2017-03-20 10:13:54,You don't have message history? Goes to splitter and I have an expander.
2017-03-20 10:07:08,@Shawhelp on the phone with an agent thanks

2017-03-20 10:00:44,"@Shawhelp internet issues, my devices say they are connected but aren't really getting a signal. Account issue or internet?"
2017-03-20 10:00:42,And there was the hunt message on the PVR display at some point after unplugging. Haven't seen it since but I went to bed after 2.
2017-03-20 09:58:37,"Also, guide remembered to record, but it didn't start until late in the prog & it was very pixellated. Same channel S0a00 now."

2017-03-19 10:36:16,Yeah your bill should be prorated to account for the outage if it's not your fault.
2017-03-19 10:33:33,came back on just now all by itself.
2017-03-19 10:33:32,"@Shawhelp Can you follow me, so I can PM you about a specific account related issue?"
2017-03-19 10:24:34,why would that only affect a few channels? The same ones all the time.
2017-03-19 10:16:29,@Shawhelp good morning! Ch.235 and 276 are off (again) in Sherwood Park. Ref code S0a00 (again). Have tried unplugging cables. #losingfaith
2017-03-19 08:42:43,thanks. It's occurred 3x now in past week or so. And self healing so must be some external factor I'm guessing.
2017-03-19 07:00:14,I also already power cycled modem and did factory reset on it. ipconfig does not show a connection to shaw server either.
2017-03-19 06:57:25,yesterday u verified that modem signal strength is good. If still true and wifi/wired is showing this then can I replace modem?
2017-03-19 03:53:55,@Shawhelp .:: not happy with the internet service anymore

2017-03-16 22:26:47,hasn't helped any. Other way to look at it might be like a very very split second freeze of the action.
2017-03-16 22:23:51,"occurs mist during play, from the high angle camera. Looks kind of like 1 frame is being dropped."

2017-03-13 09:00:38,@Shawhelp any ETA on today's outage in dwtn Vancouver? Should I prepare for another 6 hours of no work?
2017-03-13 08:42:02,@Shawhelp really again? Service in dwtn Vancouver once again eludes us. Do you have the number for #Telus ?
2017-03-13 08:16:20,bummer. Feel free to escalate my request to you network architects. Thanks regardless.
2017-03-13 08:06:17,@Shawhelp monthly IPv6 check-in. Any updates? In the meantime Google connection assistant is being helpful. pic.twitter.com/Pau3pPkxs9

2017-03-12 12:15:16,....By the way....No Canadian broadcaster has the rights to #Oliers #Habs game today? You are kidding right?!
2017-03-12 12:14:11,Oh.....So I need to spend more money on sports channels I do not have!! That's a totally​ makes consumer sense!!
2017-03-12 12:02:46,@RogersHelps @Shawhelp Hey!!! Why am I paying for center ice package if you are not going to show all the hockey games? Smells like a rip!!
2017-03-12 11:21:24,strange. There has always been a copy on both and I haven't changed settings in either recently

2017-03-08 19:15:58,@Shawhelp it's moot 4 me cuz I figured it out but your guide is screwing fans yet again tonight. B1G network has men's tournament on but
2017-03-08 19:15:41,"and... the new channels ""not available in VOD at this time"". Grr."
2017-03-08 19:11:16,reboot seems to have solved. Thx
2017-03-08 19:10:36,"@Shawhelp where have my ""TV on demand"" channels gone in SOD?! Added BBC earth, CBC & Cooking... missing my others. #notpleased #regularuser"
2017-03-08 19:02:10,one TV it seems. Will reboot
2017-03-08 19:00:34,@ShawInfo @shawhelp Big Ten Network dumped from my cable package without sufficient warning. Are you daring me to dump you?
2017-03-08 18:58:20,no pixelation. Just choppy. On off on off. Quality A1.
2017-03-08 18:56:40,no message just choppy
2017-03-08 18:51:46,global as well
2017-03-08 18:50:52,trying another channel
2017-03-08 18:50:15,watching ctv news and signal cutting out totally intermittently and right back in

2017-03-08 18:39:19,@Shawhelp our cable signal very intermittent in west #yeg . Troubles?
2017-03-08 18:25:25,Waiting for two days now for someone @Shawhelp to call me RE: my tv/net service. @TELUSsupport @telus how is your customer service? #help
2017-03-08 17:20:55,passed around to 4 different ppl. Given different info each time. Not treated like a valued customer by the loyalty. Disappointing
2017-03-08 17:03:43,it did not change anything
2017-03-08 16:44:10,thanks!
2017-03-08 16:36:26,for sure..... once the kids show is done haha
2017-03-08 16:31:22,there are only 4 channel options to click on - not the ones I am looking for/subscribe to like Treehouse. There are usually more
2017-03-08 16:27:09,@Shawhelp is there something going on with the VOD service in central Alberta?
2017-03-08 16:05:41,you've got to be kidding me!
2017-03-08 16:05:02,Sure. DM is sent.
2017-03-08 16:03:39,preferably a call back. My number is attached to my name on my Shaw account.
2017-03-08 16:00:23,I struggled to find how to trace route the Xbox Live servers specifically but I think I got it. I think we should DM for this.
2017-03-08 15:42:12,"@Shawhelp What's the point of asking me for my call back number, if you hang up on me 2 minutes ltr and don't call me back!"
2017-03-08 15:29:54,Don't bother been asking for the NFL Network HD for years. Falls on deaf ears at @Shawhelp
2017-03-08 15:11:04,done this a bunch of times…apparently there’s not enough love.
2017-03-08 14:44:13,"Why the 2nd one isn't doing the same, not sure. Time will tell. Maybe, I could get a tech to stop by to see if it's phone outlet"
2017-03-08 14:42:32,Thanks for the help and dm @Shawhelp I switched everything into my surge protector cord. Made a difference with 1 of 2 phones.
2017-03-08 14:20:53,distorted dial tone as well
2017-03-08 14:13:33,@Shawhelp my house phone is distorted
2017-03-08 14:06:44,turns out it was scheduled maintenance... Poorly communicated maintenance mind you... Oh well. It is working now. Thanks
2017-03-08 13:08:42,Not sure. I'll try to unplug everything again. I did send a DM
2017-03-08 13:04:35,I did unplug and try to re-connect everything in my home.
2017-03-08 13:03:27,How do I go about fixing that? Or can I dm to have a tech to come and fix?
2017-03-08 12:47:55,Do you if they have issues in that area?
2017-03-08 12:47:35,"Everything seems to be plugged in. Maybe, I'll have to unplug everything. I even checked my breaker box. I live is Wolseley area"
2017-03-08 12:31:11,"@Shawhelp That and the voicemail indicated they will disco my service in the next ""2-3 days"". Payment was made as scheduled. What the heck?"
2017-03-08 12:29:47,"This weather is terrible, and my landline has been like this since yesterday"
2017-03-08 12:29:07,"@Shawhelp How do I fix a ""no power at base"" issue? Phone rings, and I can't answer. Not sure if it's due to my area, weather, etc...?!"
2017-03-08 12:28:07,@Shawhelp I made a PTP through OLB and paid it. One day later your PS team is calling me. It takes more than 24 hrs for OLB. ?
2017-03-08 12:16:20,"Thank you for the offer, but after 5 years of frustration, we're done. Off to your competitor, I'm afraid."
2017-03-08 11:43:43,Been asking @Shawhelp to add @MLBNetwork for years. Will this be the season? #no #ofcoursenot #theydontwantmymoney
2017-03-08 11:23:33,You too.
2017-03-08 11:14:24,"Okay. I’ll try it out, thanks. :)"
2017-03-08 11:11:51,"maybe you personally don't, but they just end up calling Shaw support! Maybe it's time to check out Telus."
2017-03-08 11:04:51,But it isn’t a known bug that it just doesn’t work in the latest firmware or anything like that?
2017-03-08 10:58:39,(Recording all Simpsons episodes is a good way to fill the PVR fast!)
2017-03-08 10:58:17,"Good thought. :) Hey, does the “keep X episodes” option work? I set it to 5 Simpsons episodes, somehow I still have 22."
2017-03-08 10:46:58,"@Shawhelp any plans to add @beINSPORTS to your channel line-up? Why available on Shaw Direct, but not Shaw?"
2017-03-08 10:46:46,I don’t envy you guys. Being on both the forefront and tail of tech like this. Hopefully blue sky (or something) will help.
2017-03-08 10:45:54,"There’s a repeat viewing tonight at 11:30 which I’ve set the PVR to record, and hopefully it doesn’t screw me again. It’s a race!"
2017-03-08 10:33:52,@Shawhelp why you have non-stealth ports on my router? What you up to?
2017-03-08 09:57:38,dm'd
2017-03-08 09:48:14,my wife has been messing with you @jopopslongden and you have not provided any better support.

2017-03-08 09:37:46,wow. 10 days to send a technician out to sort a cable box out. The minute @telus are available you guys are toast AGAIN. Horrible
2017-03-08 09:32:05,"fyi, aebc is your cust. I'm theirs. So don't know account no. But can provide my ip if it helps"
2017-03-08 09:30:35,in the past few weeks there's been a pattern of issues around 1am and lasting ~30 minutes. Today it continues until now
2017-03-08 09:29:08,"both. I've restarted modem, WiFi router, and iPhone but continue to have random net issues. Asus router debug suggests modem side."
2017-03-08 09:17:26,@Shawhelp central city area. Connection seems flaky since around 1am and continues. Restarted modem. You doing maintenance?
2017-03-08 09:16:53,check the DM history
2017-03-08 09:05:30,"I tried that once before but I forgot how, would u tell me the steps pls?"

2017-03-07 21:54:46,I have not. I'm guessing there's a hole on the box?
2017-03-07 21:53:50,all five of the people I have spoken with have it. Feel free to check the backlog of notes on the issue
2017-03-07 21:48:54,We had the exact same issues with our internet 30 box

2017-03-07 18:23:04,@Shawhelp Help! Net around Williams Lake is horrible today.. Interac and Net down at businesses.. at home cant even stream a facebook vid. ?
2017-03-07 18:13:21,I can when I get home. I don’t know the IP for them though.

2017-03-07 17:41:15,nothing. The network channels were missing from favourites but just realized that Channel numbers have changed!
2017-03-07 17:27:43,@Shawhelp I'm in Ontario and several of my channels are missing. This happens on both my receivers. Is this a general problem?
2017-03-07 17:05:59,Just the Xbox. Open NAT as well.
2017-03-07 16:38:11,"@Shawhelp I don't see Canyon Meadows, Calgary in your list of trouble spots, but most of the sites I try to reach are, well, unreachable."
2017-03-07 16:29:22,I would use a third party router but I find it ridiculous that I need to spend my money on a new router just to play properly.
2017-03-07 16:28:13,Just using the Hitron gateway. And I have higher speeds on my MacBook that I use wirelessly.
2017-03-07 16:25:47,@Shawhelp Is it possible to switch back to normal router mode once the Shaw modem has set in bridge mode?
2017-03-07 16:18:07,It changed nothing.

2017-03-04 21:09:40,we have had issues with their customer service every single month since we signed up years ago.
2017-03-04 21:08:14,we have had shaw since it was star direct and we have never had an issue with their customer service
2017-03-04 21:07:07,"Hey, @shawhelp , who won the fight? I'm guessing ""Lassy."" Historical sports TV reference for you."
2017-03-04 21:04:31,@Shawhelp wtf? Changed the fight in the 12th round on cbs. Horrible
2017-03-04 21:04:22,Is it a requirement before being hired to be the most incompetent person alive or...? @Shawhelp @ShawInfo

2017-03-04 11:13:49,thanks. Your new 1gb storage for @Shaw .ca email accounts has moved me on to @gmail and I suspect that is by design.
2017-03-04 11:00:46,DM you? How about addressing your email issues out loud? They contain better storage than @Shawhelp but have wrong details pic.twitter.com/a2ywDYmVbC

2017-03-03 19:30:33,@Shawhelp Any plans of bringing #FreeRangeTv to the AppleTV? I noticed Competitors have AppleTV apps I'd love this!

2017-03-03 18:49:25,@Shawhelp any outage in the Minoru Richmond hospital area?
2017-03-03 18:10:02,Mostly I'm just complaining about the unexpected $30/month difference on Internet150. Likely not much you can do about that.
2017-03-03 18:07:01,Direct wired is fine. It's the wifi that tanks and we even bought a router and wifi boosters to put all throughout the house
2017-03-03 18:00:49,loyalty rewards David!
2017-03-03 17:57:56,I'm not exactly impressed that I'm going to be charged $360 more this year for being an existing rather than new customer of @Shawhelp
2017-03-03 17:54:06,5G and no baby monitors. Also had our channel changed less than a week ago and still pay for this atrocious speed
2017-03-03 17:47:56,Approx 30' away. Does the same thing with my cell phone when I'm 3'away. Constantly have to switch to data because the wifi lags
2017-03-03 17:44:54,I have no clue where said hotspot would be. And I'm.not going to walk around the streets looking for it.

2017-02-28 21:15:33,"@Shawhelp My internet cuts in and out, I reseted both my router a modem which did not help. I live in the Winnipeg area."

2017-02-28 18:41:23,"@Shawhelp Hi there, is there an outage in Langford BC?"
2017-02-28 18:36:22,@ShawHelp What is the ideal position for the CGNM-2250 modem? Should it be lying flat or standing on edge?
2017-02-28 18:32:00,@Shawhelp Why is the ShawGo Wifi extremely slow in SouthCenter Mall?

2017-02-28 17:59:43,"so aside from having sportsnet now and gamecenter, I should pay for third service? I appreciate the response but that's crazy"
2017-02-28 17:54:46,I have already submitted a request now. It's just a bit sad knowing it's probably going to get ignored. :(
2017-02-28 17:48:27,"@Shawhelp @Sportsnet @Rogers how do I have cable, the sportsnet package and gamecenter live, but I still can't watch @CanadiensMTL tn?"
2017-02-28 17:33:46,@Shawhelp Could we please finally get HD versions of @TheCW . I'm super frustrated that it's been month's since it hasn't come out yet :(
2017-02-28 17:30:36,@Shawhelp hi I have internet 150 and I'm noticing I'm not getting very fast speeds even when standing next to the router pic.twitter.com/zTqYBTZ8kS

2017-02-28 17:03:47,@Shawhelp Any internet issues in North Vancouver? My #orbi cannot get an IP address from my Shaw router
2017-02-28 17:00:37,Sounds good. I can call if that makes it easier as well. Trying to troubleshoot my PS4 one last time...Doesn't wanna play online.

2017-02-28 16:52:40,@Shawhelp If I unplug my ASUS router and plug into the Modem will the modem become my new router? Need to try some troubleshooting...Thanks!
2017-02-28 16:28:41,Hey Harvey! Sounds good will be doing that right now!
2017-02-28 15:38:03,yes and yes. Everything else works fine. May want to check with Bluesky team to ensure whether it should power off w/remote or not
2017-02-28 15:26:43,@Shawhelp internet not working here. Not sure if there's issues around Winnipeg or just Transcona area...or just our house.
2017-02-28 15:25:42,That does turn it off. Just doesn't seem to be a way to turn it off with the remote.
2017-02-28 15:16:40,@Shawhelp Should my Bluesky TV box (the PVR) be on all the time? Remote doesn't power it off when I hit the All Power button.
2017-02-28 15:13:42,we called. There is issue. Technician dispatched.
2017-02-28 15:12:54,dm sent
2017-02-28 14:58:13,@Shawhelp service outage in north van?
2017-02-28 14:52:48,"I’m also in north van, internet is down"
2017-02-28 14:00:47,"seems like with all the other devices attempting to send larger packets, it would be more hassle than it's worth keeping it low?"
2017-02-28 13:51:14,Yes. I see all other networks available to us.
2017-02-28 13:41:09,"and here's the article I used to hack my FW https:// community.sophos.com/products/unifi ed-threat-management/f/management-networking-logging-and-reporting/80230/how-to-ignore-my-isps-dhcp-mtu-of-only-576 … . The curious bit is that with auto enabled, it forced 576."

2017-02-28 13:22:08,@Shawhelp just discovered DHCP was setting my firewall’s MTU to 576. Is this a Shaw thing? I hacked it back to 1500 and it’s WAY FASTER.
2017-02-28 13:21:19,@Shawhelp this was one of our reasons for being with #shawservices since '97. #disappointing
2017-02-28 13:13:24,ive already spoken to your team who offered $10 off for 12 months... @TekSavvyCSR you guys want a new customer?
2017-02-28 13:03:49,can you see if cable is live to suite 406?
2017-02-28 13:02:16,"@Shawhelp no incentive to stay when deleting services like webpage, shared videos & pictures. Disappointed in #shawservices . In store zero"
2017-02-28 13:01:15,Get this. My mum has paid $46 /month for 7 yrs for Internet 1! That's 1 Mbps download!! That's right shady @Shawhelp
2017-02-28 12:52:40,wired. Tried everything. Right down to a new modem. It's the routing I'm pretty sure. Other people on west Canada had the sameprob
2017-02-28 12:38:43,Has someone's looked into the routing issues? Got dced from Twitch and Battlenet last night. @Shawhelp seems to be an on going issue.
2017-02-28 12:27:31,@Shawhelp ...I don't seem to be able to find the cord leading to Trump. It may be battery powered. Would dropping from 10k work?
2017-02-28 12:09:00,thx!
2017-02-28 12:03:03,I use Comwave who use your cable and the cable connection is where the problem is 1122 gilford st van

2017-02-28 11:40:16,I think I fixed it. Meanwhile I cannot DM you if you don't follow me.
2017-02-28 11:34:21,@Shawhelp all Shaw services are down for me. working is impossible.
2017-02-28 11:06:03,This is like step 50. There is no way. I will advocate how terrible your service is whenever people bring it up.
2017-02-28 10:46:07,"Sorry, I missed this message yesterday! Will DM account info now. :)"
2017-02-28 10:38:33,"I knew just tweeting you would help,thanks again"

2017-02-28 10:24:41,"you helped me before,I tried the unplugging and by passing the wifi router etc,still low if any internet,upgrading didn't help?.."
2017-02-28 10:05:52,"@Shawhelp your fix helped for two days,for two months now we have been only getting kbs,not even mbs,but you still charge us for full data?"
2017-02-28 09:47:26,"Hello and thanks for your message, we are the TV station, @Shawhelp should be able to assist with you this inquiry, thank you!"
2017-02-28 09:41:26,I hope it all works well too. I'll be watching it closely thanks :)
2017-02-28 09:31:38,"Honestly, don't you ever think about how s-l-o-w internet used to be? The days of dial-up? Ugh. My kids will never know! Thanks @Shawhelp"
2017-02-28 09:27:52,@Shawhelp hey can you try resetting my modem? Tried some troubleshooting last night and made issue worse
2017-02-28 08:46:46,wireless it's the only way I can do it
2017-02-28 08:43:49,seems good now. I
2017-02-28 08:39:23,future and present
2017-02-28 08:30:33,Hi @Shawhelp several clients (all shaw.ca email users) complain they're not getting my emails. This has happened before. Pls fix
2017-02-28 08:01:07,"Unplugged it again. Worked this time. I can't keep doing this, though. What should I do to get reliability?"
2017-02-28 07:48:19,"No internet at all this morning, won't even connect to wifi. I work from home & have deadlines. When can this be fixed? pic.twitter.com/A9TL4e8frK"

2017-02-28 00:23:01,@Shawhelp @ShawInfo your internet outages remind me of my first 300 baud modem. Thnx for the walk down memory lane. #ymm #dialup pic.twitter.com/KEPPvXaXHg
2017-02-28 00:20:21,@Shawhelp why does ur tv cut out so much
2017-02-28 00:15:55,@Shawhelp please fix your internet service in Fort McMurray. I get more consistent bandwidth with two cans and a length of string.
2017-02-28 00:08:23,the listing for it still doesn't show up on the onscreen guide.
2017-02-27 23:09:35,LOL I just dced from OW too!!!
2017-02-27 23:06:08,seems to still be happening. Also can't connect to OW servers so it seems like it's just shaw?
2017-02-27 23:05:50,yep! happened to me as well. A couple of friends also west coast shaw went down.
2017-02-27 23:02:43,to contact my internet service provider
2017-02-27 23:02:29,"@Shawhelp Why do I keep getting disconnected from gaming servers on Xbox, but not disc from the internet? They already helped me and said..."
2017-02-27 22:56:58,"Negative, Discord and World of Warcraft are the only services that were running at the time. Both use very little upload."
2017-02-27 22:54:55,servers come up timed out anyways. :(
2017-02-27 22:54:49,thats odd because it happened in League and Now Overwatch. Both game servers are having issues?
2017-02-27 22:54:22,Thanks for letting me know! Keep us updated plz
2017-02-27 22:53:45,@Shawhelp Im getting full internet dc's on @Warcraft Every 10 minutes or so any idea why?? its happening to my friends with in the area also
2017-02-27 22:52:00,Good guy Shaw... Watch he won't reply (now he will)
2017-02-27 22:51:49,"wired directly to the modem. Seems to be an upload issue as my VoIP software i can hear people, but they cannot hear me speak."
2017-02-27 22:50:17,@Shawhelp Are there any outages in Downtown Vancouver? I haven't had internet all day.
2017-02-27 22:49:18,@Shawhelp wtf is going on with you net!? Keep getting d/c from wow
2017-02-27 22:49:05,6 Outages in Southern Alberta / Saskatchewan
2017-02-27 22:48:32,"@Shawhelp Hello Shaw I keep dropping from online games but not from my internet, is this shaws issue or the games?"
2017-02-27 22:41:11,wifi
2017-02-27 22:38:19,"That makes 4 outages, getting a bit ridiculous."
2017-02-27 22:29:10,"@Shawhelp Third outage in about 20 mins in the saskatchewan area, Temporary drop for 2 mins. Trying to drink in the glory."
2017-02-27 22:25:32,@Shawhelp our shaw internet has been very laggy lately. Anything I can do to try to fix it before calling you guys to inquire?
2017-02-27 22:20:03,Cool! First day with Blue Sky and I'm enjoying it so far.
2017-02-27 22:16:12,No idea who took the photos that are on the screensaver
2017-02-27 22:15:28,"150. I get 178 down, 15 up. Wired. I just lost all connections to the server. The passed two weeks I've just had bad connection."
2017-02-27 22:13:40,@Shawhelp I'd like to nominate a photo I took for the BlueSky TV screensaver. Haha! Near James Short Parkade in downtown Calgary. pic.twitter.com/ubgZmKSC7d
2017-02-27 22:11:46,while streaming. It's been really crappy connections for the passed two weeks almost.
2017-02-27 22:09:16,@TwitchSupport @Shawhelp completely lost connection to the twitch server with shaw. Anyone else?
2017-02-27 21:36:32,all working now
2017-02-27 21:20:10,Thanks! Just frustrating to have to spend the entire evening in the bedroom
2017-02-27 20:56:21,if it's not up soon I expect compensation for the inconvenience of 2 days w/out my ShawWebmail acct. This was my main address
2017-02-27 20:55:49,"OK, did that but it didn't work: I'm back to the same four green lights"
2017-02-27 20:55:23,still no luck...phoned surf and they say it's a shaw problem but doesn't look like any shaw customers are mentioning similar issue
2017-02-27 20:55:10,this is also a issue for @Shawhelp customers. I know of at least 3 streamers with problems
2017-02-27 20:52:25,can you be more clear? Sunday morning I couldn't log on. It's Monday night.
2017-02-27 20:52:11,funny thing is it is only mine out of 6 emails on the account
2017-02-27 20:49:59,"Hey @ShawInfo - this is ridiculous! My email has been down for ""maintenance"" for over a day now. What's the hold up!? @Shawhelp"

2017-02-27 16:22:24,@Shawhelp I see you have a new service with 150mbit called FibrePlus.Curious about that advertised speed. Do you have fibre to the premises?
2017-02-27 16:20:47,"Just to confirm, you don't need 30 days notice to cancel anymore? Thanks!"
2017-02-27 16:02:00,@Shawhelp any idea when the email problems in the lower mainland area will be repaired? This has been a long outage.

2017-02-27 09:05:15,"I do not think it has that option, i think its only at 2.4 ghz. Turning off/on power helps temporarily, same as resetting settings"
2017-02-27 08:48:27,its wireless and it cuts off almost at random at any given day and hour at just about often.
2017-02-27 08:24:37,OK. Thank you for the information. Sounds like a pretty major problem.
2017-02-27 08:06:31,@shawhelp what is the estimated time for email to be back up? Down since about 2am.
2017-02-27 07:17:02,Monday at 0700h and email is down again. Is there an ETA on when service will be restored @Shawhelp ? #yyc #webmail #email
2017-02-27 00:44:04,Unfortunately @ShawInfo @Shawhelp my Gateway died & nobody will fix it until Mar 5! Therefore I missed the whole thing & couldn't PVR it! https:// twitter.com/drewsavage/sta tus/836092389211029504 …

2017-02-26 22:26:27,@Shawhelp You have a malfunction? My PVR rewind and channel changer hasn't worked right all evening. Don't think it's the remote battery.
2017-02-26 21:50:43,Oh never mind. The old turn-it-off-turn-it-on trick worked.

2017-02-26 19:15:26,sorry no luck there either.
2017-02-26 19:04:14,I shall try both ideas! Thanks people
2017-02-26 19:00:35,Have you tried unplugging the cable box then plugging it back in? That usually works for me.
2017-02-26 18:50:29,@Shawhelp Trying to watch the Oscars. I've tried a few channels and they're all pixelated with messed up audio. Any way to fix?
2017-02-26 18:34:44,tried that. Didn’t help. Uploads bad too. About 1Mbps. Also did a factory reset on my router to rule that out.
2017-02-26 18:27:19,been a couple hours and no surprise my internet isn't working again.
2017-02-26 18:10:36,Doesn't help when I am trying to PVR ... not happy

2017-02-26 17:33:57,@Shawhelp is there a way you can see if something is wrong with my modem? Speed tests show about 2Mbps down. Normally that’s around 150

2017-02-26 16:15:54,Hey @Shawhelp . Can I get a new remote from your location in Erlton?
2017-02-26 15:19:16,@Shawhelp Thx Tim from Winnipeg for such great #customerservice . It is rare these days! #internet
2017-02-26 14:49:59,direct to the modem. Got a new Hitron modem Friday and used the new coax that came with it. Reset on the modem and working for now
2017-02-26 14:05:15,Yes. I guess nobody is showing up today since I haven't gotten a call. Support booked a time on Mar. 6. Better get a credit.
2017-02-26 14:00:01,"OK, I have a newer DVR, too, in another room I guess I could swap them around. Good to know, thanks."
2017-02-26 13:47:07,@Shawhelp great timing for my Gateway to die. Now I can't watch the red carpet. Better be fixed by Tuesday for #ThisIsUs
2017-02-26 13:43:39,I don't understand what a VOD movie has to do with TV networks???
2017-02-26 13:39:28,"I have to find a hearing person...Apparently yes, there is sound. But no picture and no captioning."
2017-02-26 13:26:49,"The same, TSN3. They should be showing the same thing."
2017-02-26 13:10:00,@Shawhelp Any idea why TSN3 works on channel 183 but channel 238 just comes up as a black screen? 237 and 236 are fine.
2017-02-26 12:58:16,"been talking with you guys for WEEKS. had a tech not show up, one come & forget to activate modem, now ANOTHER coming tmrw"

2017-02-26 12:19:21,"-removed a questionable splitter, cycled power again. look at our history, power cycling the modem always works. Happens a lot."
2017-02-26 12:07:33,when Jules came out last week he replaced all components except the wall plate. (And the modem I suppose)
2017-02-26 12:05:20,yeah they used to use Sportsnet Oiler. Not sure why that channel is dark today
2017-02-26 12:04:45,we have done that several times as well.
2017-02-26 12:04:05,I don't grok why they won't just give me a modem and let me use a non grabage router #IPTVSucks

2017-02-24 20:30:01,ought to have said “add more [than] the 10” instead. ‘Then’ doesn't compare; ‘than’ does.
2017-02-24 20:28:34,4 more

2017-02-24 18:52:53,"no, and I never have issues with watching anything. Perhaps it's on @Sportsnet side of things?"
2017-02-24 18:50:24,thanks! Phone is back up to 45 which is sufficient.
2017-02-24 18:47:10,my laptop is getting 176mbps but android phone is only getting 15. Am restarting router now...

2017-02-19 19:42:58,should have told me and admitted that it was the reps error but also my fault for not looking at bill. Very disappointed.
2017-02-19 19:40:07,much later I noticed we continued to be charged for the phone. I told the rep and fwded the email from your rep and was told he
2017-02-19 19:38:01,in the email from the shaw rep confirming cancellation of the service he never mentioned the terminal needed to be returned.
2017-02-19 19:32:45,is this a systemic issue? I would not have switched to Blue Sky if I knew Timeshift was not available. Is there an ETA 4 fixing?
2017-02-19 19:31:32,I've cancelled&switched. Not looking for refund/credit. I want to file complaint as the deceptive practice prob affecting others.
2017-02-19 19:24:36,I was also online with the support desk. There is still an issue for whatever reason. So the disappointment continues.

2017-02-18 12:09:55,"Thanks for the assistance, @Shawhelp Appreciate it."
2017-02-18 11:57:46,"it's not that you don't provide the channel, it's that you only provide it in low definition!!!!! Get it together!!!"
2017-02-18 11:54:46,"Shaw satellite has been down for over an hour in Langdon, Alberta. Whats going on? Any news?"

2017-02-18 10:32:42,it always seems to be this one channel I have a problem with.
2017-02-18 10:25:10,still not available. Should I unplug the box and replug the power cord?
2017-02-18 10:23:23,the Standard FX channel is also like this. HD version of FX is ok though. pic.twitter.com/bNK3f0pRwG

2017-02-18 08:23:37,"you have fully avoided the issues brought up Instead offering, yet again, basic troubleshooting tips for a year long problem"
2017-02-18 08:17:31,When will you start offering an uninterrupted service or at least the ability to submit a ticket the goes past the wire tech?
2017-02-18 08:16:28,I've yet to hear from a network tech at any level for any of the issues I have reported
2017-02-18 08:14:14,you can even check the last time the wire tech was out here He said it was dropping packets but he didn't know why Still no fix
2017-02-18 08:13:17,I don't even know how many times I have done this now Over a year now non stop issues Random DCs and inconsistent speeds

2017-02-17 20:21:26,@Shawhelp why is my upload speed so insanely slow
2017-02-17 19:38:06,"yes there is other devices connected, that should not be an issue. Safemode? I have never seen a setting for that."
2017-02-17 19:23:24,"every hour on the hour, ex. 5:07 then at 6:07 then at 7:07. I do not see the lights because its in a different room."

2017-02-17 17:58:29,. @Shawhelp my upload speed is 10kb/sec. is this what's expected for a customer that's paying you 70/mo?
2017-02-17 17:48:45,I will. Thank you!
2017-02-17 17:42:40,"yes, tonnes. That's why I switched. @Shawhelp has a great 150MB/s deal right now."

2017-02-17 15:14:17,@Shawhelp in addition to internet issue is there a shaw cable outage or is it isolated to my location. YYC NW
2017-02-17 15:12:22,@Shawhelp is there an internet issue in YYC NW?
2017-02-17 14:57:52,"yes, I have been monitoring. For the past 2 wks, there have been different shows aired (not just on Fridays).Something is haywire!"

2017-02-17 14:23:15,wish I cd but our cable provider @Shawhelp has different shows airing than advertised by @DrOz . So strange!

2017-02-16 02:56:01,@Shawhelp You really couldn't have sent an email saying you had scheduled maintenance? You just cut the service?
2017-02-16 02:44:23,"Ranges from complete several-minute outage to quick hiccups in connection to partial outages (some sites load, VOIP doesnt work)"

2017-02-14 22:08:09,@Shawhelp it was really unfortunate that the FS1 feed died right near the end of the #WestminsterDogShow . Any idea if it wil be on again?
2017-02-14 22:07:11,it's unfortunate. Probably not sadly
2017-02-14 22:04:22,"ya no doubt! happened one to many times, can u imagine if it was the #SuperBowl Who cares about customer satisfaction?"
2017-02-14 22:03:26,no it went to Border Security!!! Everyone missed best in Show!!!!!!
2017-02-14 22:02:26,"it's too late, the suspense is over now that we know the winner. I'm being a drama queen because I can #solongNatGeo"
2017-02-14 21:57:19,Couple people complaining to @Shawhelp but they don't understand actual issue yet.
2017-02-14 21:53:17,it's like finding out the last page of a book has been rippetd out so pissed
2017-02-14 21:50:22,I'm choosing to blame FS1. I'll try and catch the end when it is on again. Spoiler alert: German Shepherd won.
2017-02-14 21:49:23,"well, the show is over. If it were the SuperBowl I'm sure the backlash would be greater"
2017-02-14 21:48:03,"Way to go @Shawhelp for screwing up another program at an important time! Switching carriers, I'm sick of this shit! #WestminsterDogShow"
2017-02-14 21:46:19,yeah I know. I'll be cancelling that channel tomorrow.
2017-02-14 21:46:07,No it was channel 241. Its back now but we didn't get to see the end of the previous show.
2017-02-14 21:44:58,@Shawhelp please find out wth happened tonight with @NatGeoChannel & #WestminsterDogShow bc this is basically what I live for every year
2017-02-14 21:43:42,Who should I be directing my rage at over this dog show feed debacle? @Shawhelp @NatGeoChannel @FS1 ??
2017-02-14 21:39:18,@FS1 @ShawTVWinnipeg @Shawhelp I've waited 2 months to watch @WKCDOGS and the feed drops. Very unhappy. #WestminsterDogShow

2017-02-05 20:49:51,@Shawhelp not impressed that Shaw Gateway barfed during Superbowl OT. Definitely considering another tv provider.
2017-02-05 20:44:00,@Shawhelp great work Shaw. Galaxy lost connection and the last 7 minutes & OT of Superbowl gets skipped. Time for Telus.
2017-02-05 20:39:02,WTF @Shawhelp ? Our feed just cut out in the final seconds of the superbowl. Your gateway box is SO glitchy it's unbelievable.

2017-01-29 14:22:17,Unplugged the box and plugged it back in. Seems to be working now.

2017-01-24 23:23:44,"@Shawhelp is there maintenance going on in Prince Albert? Bills caught up, unplugged for 10 seconds, still nothing"
2017-01-24 23:10:05,@Shawhelp can you fix my wifi I'm sick of calling you
2017-01-24 22:15:12,Connection is back for now. Hopefully it will last longer than 15 minutes this time.
2017-01-24 22:04:57,"after the power cycle, those same lights return to previous state"
2017-01-24 22:02:24,"power, ds, us, online are solid green. Wireless link is blinking green. All other lights off."
2017-01-24 21:54:01,"I only have the wireless, but I'll get a good connection to the router, but the router will have no connection to the internet."
2017-01-24 21:28:28,have tried resetting both and just killed power for 5 minutes still no luck finding the gateway
2017-01-24 21:18:39,will try that. Thanks
2017-01-24 21:13:46,hi Shaw. Tried resetting but still not able to find gate way. Wifi works fine. Regular cable is fine but not tv conn w gateway
2017-01-24 21:01:12,ya no thanks. I can't afford to pay you guy any more money.
2017-01-24 20:54:24,I have been with shaw for 10 years paying 200 hundred a month. Loyalty is dead.
2017-01-24 20:50:58,one of your douche bag guys called be today
2017-01-24 20:33:59,"Wow @ShawInfo @ShawHelp , that's some amazing speed. Thanks for the great deal! http://www. speedtest.net/my-result/5995 493519 … #speedtest"
2017-01-24 20:16:57,thank you. Please tweet when it's working if possible.
2017-01-24 20:08:43,@Shawhelp internet and phone are down? Tv iffy. Anything going on in WPG?
2017-01-24 19:43:06,@Shawhelp is there a problem with the email server right now?
2017-01-24 19:34:20,"st.James , portage and moray."

2017-01-24 18:52:46,actually they aren't back up and running
2017-01-24 18:45:20,looks to have resolved itself after 10 minutes was a wired connection btw
2017-01-24 18:44:45,"yes it is, got help and it worked for 10mins now back to the video/audio breaking up"
2017-01-24 18:37:30,@Shawhelp is Abbotsford getting any maintenance as my internet just died
2017-01-24 18:19:10,@Shawhelp @ShawRetail quit fucken calling me at dinner time.. fucken Christmas all mighty. You call me again at dinner time I'm dumping shaw
2017-01-24 18:04:34,@Shawhelp Any way to help us with our cable box? It keeps turning off and it's insanely slow when we're trying to use the remote.
2017-01-24 17:34:27,"Yes, I have it on Shaw as well. I can't stand CBC ads on #FoxNews though! It's INSULTING! @Shawhelp @FoxNews @TheRebelTV @ezralevant #MCGA https:// twitter.com/brigantiaes/st atus/824037851117391872 …"
2017-01-24 17:15:53,@Shawhelp what's wrong with the cable in YYc it's just breaking up
2017-01-24 15:51:37,"Yah, I expected *burst* speeds, but not sustained. Nice! #GetWhatYouPayFor ! @Shawhelp"
2017-01-24 15:49:08,They would never ask for your SIN why would they ever need it?
2017-01-24 15:46:45,"Wow, Did she call back to the same number that called her? I was warned there is a lot of Phishing going on."
2017-01-24 15:45:01,To be clear @Moe456 My friend called @Shawhelp - it was not a call she received. It was definitely a Shaw employee she was speaking with
2017-01-24 15:42:34,It was probably Phishing. I just got one from Pay Pal that was a scam too.
2017-01-24 15:37:44,I usually track speeds of 160-180mbps on a 150 connection.
2017-01-24 15:35:39,I have called @Shawhelp many times myself & have never been asked for my S.I.N. - nor would I supply it if I was. #yvr
2017-01-24 15:34:17,Friend said @Shawhelp call centre demanded she supply S.I.N. -said mandatory She refused Called back-was informed no such practice exists
2017-01-24 15:34:15,Problem fixed. Must have been from ShowCase as a different show is now on instead of normal program.
2017-01-24 15:34:00,I must share that I'm very impressed with #ShawCable delivering more than their advertised speeds. Lesson to the competition. @ShawHelp
2017-01-24 15:27:05,@Shawhelp any suggestions on why my gateway can't be found on my tv but still appears to be recording etc? Thanks
2017-01-24 15:21:54,@Shawhelp is there a outage in surrey for cable and wifi
2017-01-24 11:32:06,I think you need to add me as well for this to work.
2017-01-24 11:17:33,"Sorry @Shawhelp , 2 calls to your service centres in 2 days, and both calls were insulting. Switching to @telus was never an easier choice."
2017-01-24 11:09:40,"For anyone who doesn't already know, @Shawhelp is one of the best accts for Customer Service on Twitter. Amazing. Quick. Helpful. Awesome."
2017-01-24 10:57:18,"trust me if it was available in my area I totally would! 15mbs compared to 150mbs, FOR THE SAME PRICE!"
2017-01-24 10:56:03,I kicked them with their carbon tax announcement. @Shawhelp has been great so far. BlueSky TV is a big upgrade too
2017-01-24 10:22:37,yeah it's pretty bad. Your technician was sick and just didn't show up and CS didn't bother to cover his appointments.
2017-01-24 10:06:43,using modem supplied by you guys. All lights just flash on and off. All internet off
2017-01-24 09:37:34,@Shawhelp is there issues in Acadia Calgary? We've been without net for hours. Reset doesnt work.
2017-01-24 08:52:37,"OK, cool. Thanks for the speedy reply. I await eagerly :-)"
2017-01-24 08:44:37,Hey @shawhelp does the new Blue Sky TV have an iOS or Android app to control the recordings and such? Like Gateway does.
2017-01-24 08:39:37,yep...they all get going once the reset is done. It's just a pain in the butt that it has to be done often. I miss analog
2017-01-24 08:33:14,Your CS has no ability to do much of anything with respect to getting an installer out promptly following a no show.
2017-01-24 08:31:41,I spoke with them 4 times yesterday and they are still waiting to get confirmation of a new time... Brutal customer service.
2017-01-24 08:30:08,I end doing the main portal and if that doesn't work for them all then I reset the ones that don't kick in
2017-01-24 08:29:57,"thanks Ken, I'll make sure to call in soon to discuss the options you offer!"
2017-01-24 08:19:03,@ShawBusiness @Shawhelp No show yesterday for internet install and still haven't given me a confirmed time. #badcustomerservice

2017-01-23 21:25:56,"Hey @Shawhelp , can you please order the episodes on FreeRange from beginning to end like every other streaming service?"

2017-01-23 16:59:14,the site says fix in progress... so if it is known what the fix is there has to be some sort of time frame

2017-01-23 09:41:29,I hear things like bridging the modem or static ip addresses. It know. O thing about that stuff and don't want to make it worse.
2017-01-23 09:40:28,that was why I upgraded to internet 150 but the issue still persists.

2017-01-23 09:38:06,ok well now for the big one that ties it all together. I'm sure you've heard it before. We have 2 Xbox ones.
2017-01-23 09:29:22,cgmn-2250 I meant
2017-01-23 09:28:52,ok so next question lol. We have the hitron Chen-2250. Is that still ok with the internet 150 or should it be upgraded?
2017-01-23 09:23:52,ok well that brings me to my next question. When plugged in with the Ethernet cable does it auto use the 5ghz?

2017-01-22 00:27:41,@Shawhelp Why am I having to reset my modem twice a day all of a sudden? What gives?
2017-01-21 21:35:29,what I don't get is that everything shows connection but it just keeps spinning and then says it can't connect
2017-01-21 21:33:43,"no, the wifi keeps dropping out so it won't connect."
2017-01-21 21:29:20,is this an online thing? I'm not hard wired in so my computer won't load the browser. Can it be done on he phone?
2017-01-21 21:16:43,it's cutting in and out so bad right now that I can't use my wifi to chat with you.
2017-01-21 21:16:18,months now. Direct TV or a direct hookup to internet?
2017-01-21 21:05:23,"@Shawhelp why is ur internet connection so spotty? Dropping in & out all the time. Called help desk, done what's recommended & still bad."
2017-01-21 19:24:20,weird

2017-01-21 19:13:18,seeing this low connection speed when we r subscribed to 150 is disappointing
2017-01-21 19:11:44,tested again 16.6
2017-01-21 19:11:03,"have a computer guy here, cat 5e cable, used another speed test program and it showed 14.6 Mb/s?¿? He says this is more accurate"
2017-01-21 19:07:20,"using 6 foot cable, during last test was between 45 and 60, but finish number is 72, ping is 26"
2017-01-21 19:01:03,while running test it bounces from 70 to 53
2017-01-21 19:00:23,"tested computer connected via ethernet cable using ookla, 73.3 Mb/s"
2017-01-21 18:55:42,"did it, working again. Seems we have to do this on a weekly basis lately, any advice?"

2017-01-21 17:14:11,Just did. Hopefully you get this fixed. Not pleased & considering other options since 16 yrs of loyalty appears to mean nothing.

2017-01-21 17:09:51,"k. If that doesn't work, what's your suggestion?"

2017-01-21 14:54:25,"Hey @Shawhelp , a bit of advice: when you have a customer who's upset and on the verge of leaving you, maybe don't not show up & lie to them."
2017-01-21 13:23:19,DM'd info
2017-01-21 13:13:13,@Shawhelp can I make changes to my TV and internet package through you

2017-01-21 10:16:52,@Shawhelp NFL Network (channel 150) still not in HD! Why? Lobby from @TSN_Sports or @Sportsnet ?
2017-01-21 09:35:31,the channels do come back after a few minutes. It's just more of an annoyance.
2017-01-21 09:19:24,"@Shawhelp why does my cable keep saying ""no content""? I've unplugged it 2x, and every hour it happens again. Is there an issue in the area?"

2017-01-20 20:31:15,ok I have tried that and still nothing. The internet modem only has the power light on solid and the Ds light is flashing.
2017-01-20 20:18:40,it's T2J 4E3. This is on every channel. If that helps pic.twitter.com/KHVc0yE014
2017-01-20 20:14:03,@Shawhelp internet just died in west edmonton. Modem is showing all connected.
2017-01-20 20:11:40,"not that I'm aware of. I could understand that if it was one tv, but it's every tv in the house"
2017-01-20 20:02:26,@Shawhelp any outages in Calgary? We have no TV or internet
2017-01-20 19:53:58,I've reset the box daily. No known issues in my area not much support. a bill for centre ice and other Channels I cannot watch

2017-01-20 18:59:01,all lights on the back for each plugged in cable are flashing.
2017-01-20 18:56:37,hitron modem. Only the 2.4G and 5G buttons are flashing currently. Neither wired connection works either.
2017-01-20 18:49:04,cycled the modem/router. No connectivity since 6:10 MST
2017-01-20 18:35:11,Anyone else on Shaw in Clareview without Internet? @shawhelp
2017-01-20 18:29:38,@Shawhelp Hey i thought there wasn't going to be any problems cancelling the cable
2017-01-20 18:21:56,"not letting me DM you, try Dm'ing ME. I'm not calling tech, it's a waste of time"
2017-01-20 18:18:05,Just have to clean up after them first pic.twitter.com/r6wtllPwSP
2017-01-20 18:11:43,"same as two nights ago, no cable. Call tech support for an hour and can't resolve problem. Service is getting to be a joke"
2017-01-20 18:01:11,@Shawhelp your cable outages in Williams Lake are becoming too frequent. It's time to give @TELUS and @TELUSsupport a call I think.
2017-01-20 17:45:32,bufferbloat also occurs in the download direction. Upload often worse only since the same size buffer takes longer.
2017-01-20 17:22:01,I understand that. It's the heavy sighing and complaining to the customer that's unnecessary
2017-01-20 16:58:37,business
2017-01-20 16:51:30,yup still nothing is working..we should be getting some compensation for this.
2017-01-20 16:51:17,signal loss detected on all tvs unplugged and restarted still not working
2017-01-20 16:31:16,@Shawhelp cable and wifi out in coquitlam

2017-01-20 16:00:53,"@Shawhelp how much to add Disney XD, and Disney HD to the wide-open popular channels? Or is it cheaper to go to the next tear up?"

2017-01-20 14:20:00,"That's awesome, Ken. TYSM! Recommendation comes from Jay Johnstone. He loved his time there and recommended it to me!"
2017-01-20 12:57:08,@shawhelp just realized it can't be my computer if it affects every other device on my network.
2017-01-20 12:49:45,@Shawhelp is trying to fix my issue but they still have no idea what's going on. I am forced to reformat my system to confirm it isn't me.
2017-01-20 11:38:49,@Shawhelp are there promotions going on for customers of 14+ years for cable?
2017-01-20 10:05:52,it's back now. Thx

2017-01-20 08:10:56,"thanks, I will."
2017-01-20 08:08:42,I will start my day by sleeping!
2017-01-20 08:03:53,look at all the past tweets still unresolved
2017-01-20 08:03:42,I think someone is trying to hack my network. Can I get you to change my IP address?
2017-01-20 06:51:32,@Shawhelp I just received a phishing attempt from a shaw.ca address - please ensure this is a one-off.
2017-01-20 06:09:28,@Shawhelp so have you sent a maintenance guy over to my building yet to fix my net?
2017-01-19 22:50:03,"just did it that and it worked, thanks :)"

2017-01-19 21:23:25,every channel I try to watch says that it has something about the show i was gonna watch is not available in my area....
2017-01-19 21:07:09,@Shawhelp any idea why our DVR is skipping chunks of time? Mostly the beginning 10-20 mins of shows after about 2 mins in.
2017-01-19 20:34:12,she claims it made it worse and she now has no guide showing up
2017-01-19 20:29:37,sounds good. Also what can you tell me about this bluesky tv? Website didn't really give much for a description
2017-01-19 20:29:01,"Sorry, no pliers or vice grips. Any non-mechanical options?"
2017-01-19 20:24:40,the cable button on the remote
2017-01-19 20:24:20,"when she's scrolling through channels, it keeps freezing and the cable button blinks red"
2017-01-19 20:23:40,"it's dropping off line entirely and repeatedly. I changed the channel this morning per shaw instructions online, still happening."
2017-01-19 20:21:41,I'll look. I was afraid of damaging equipment.
2017-01-19 20:21:32,"@Shawhelp what channels come with the movie network package? Is it just HBO, and the 3 movie networks?"
2017-01-19 20:21:19,"... told her to just call @Shawhelp but ""they don't know what they're doing"""
2017-01-19 20:16:39,@Shawhelp my Hitron constantly needs to be restarted. tried changing the channel but still having trouble. Could this be an outage?
2017-01-19 20:14:45,"Actually, no. The service tech that out in December screwed everything together so tight I can't get any of them loose."
2017-01-19 20:09:32,I just have the one.
2017-01-19 20:00:11,@Shawhelp TV service has been cutting out all night. I reset the portal once. Lasted 15 mins. Happened last month as well. Ready to cancel.

2017-01-19 08:37:19,so this is the first time it's happened since I switch in Dec/16 - came home last night after work - nothing connected

2017-01-18 23:47:30,@Shawhelp Why is there a 10 second lag with my remote to my TV through your box? It does this every couple of months?
2017-01-18 23:47:01,for some reason those channels aren't available in HD and the game wasn't on center ice.
2017-01-18 22:59:24,"any time, Just want to give you the 4-1-1 on that subject."

2017-01-18 19:44:54,"difficult, not impossible, you guys should be more on top of stuff like that, especially when it's YOUR fault #OwnUpToIt"
2017-01-18 19:43:28,thanks for the info.
2017-01-18 19:42:53,"no problem, your just lucky the @NHLJets game is still working. Must be twitter overload #pavelec"
2017-01-18 19:38:31,Winnipeg
2017-01-18 19:30:49,"I don't, just internet."
2017-01-18 19:30:39,"@Shawhelp is there a internet disruption downtown winnipeg? Can't get wifi going, looks like everyone in building is off and on too ?"
2017-01-18 19:20:10,@Shawhelp my internet is down. Resetting modem doesn't help. Is there a network issue?
2017-01-18 19:04:24,@Shawhelp My cable box is responding slowly to remote requests. Is that a network issue?
2017-01-18 18:55:43,probably as disappointing as the Jets season.
2017-01-18 18:52:11,Dear @Sportsnet @RogersNHLGCL @Shawhelp who's responsible this time? So much money so disappointed!
2017-01-18 18:48:11,will do
2017-01-18 18:46:30,"Hey @Shawhelp is that supposed to be ""Prairies""? Channel 183 (TSN3) pic.twitter.com/rg1lkzj3kb"
2017-01-18 18:37:44,it does not happen as often with the iPhone app
2017-01-18 18:34:57,@Shawhelp need some help with our Gateway PVR box - I sent you a DM
2017-01-18 18:25:05,"Note - @Shawhelp is fantastic, let's just all hope for a firmware update soon."
2017-01-18 18:22:13,Sportsnet is the eff'n worst! Total bush league.
2017-01-18 18:21:26,allows works but often have to reauthenticate every few uses. They noted it's the cable provider requiring it and not them
2017-01-18 18:21:21,@Sportsnet @NHL @ShawInfo @Shawhelp Where can i find the Pittsburgh / Montreal game in HD in British Columbia?
2017-01-18 18:19:23,@Shawhelp what channel is the Jets game on tonight?
2017-01-18 18:17:01,does it consist of live/not on demand 4K TV? That's really all that matters to anyone
2017-01-18 18:14:49,@Shawhelp why do I have to continuously authenticate my Sportsnet app on my Apple TV? Sportsnet claims it's a cable provider issue
2017-01-18 18:06:37,thanks!
2017-01-18 18:04:02,I actually ended up getting a chat agent - thanks tho! Appreciate it!
2017-01-18 18:01:02,I am fully aware of what 4K is - what's not answered is **when** you'll be carrying 4K channels. You're falling behind Telus...
2017-01-18 17:56:39,"zzz .. found the stream on sprtsnet.ca, annoying having to tie up my bandwidth when it's on pacific, a chanel subscribe to"
2017-01-18 17:55:44,Hi I want to help my landlords activate their new digital cable box. Is this something you can help with?
2017-01-18 17:53:06,Why bother paying for basic cable when can't even watch Winnipeg Jets games? @Shawhelp #angry
2017-01-18 17:51:34,just wondering how we might expect that you will be competing with Telus in these areas
2017-01-18 17:49:51,is there any particular reason for that? Telus carries all of them and all in HD... plus they have 4KTV - which you don't at all.
2017-01-18 17:49:16,Hey @Shawhelp - still having cable box issues after signal boost + swapping boxes with upstairs. Can we schedule a tech to come out and fix?
2017-01-18 17:47:20,@Shawhelp what's the problem in Poco with cable and eta on fixing it???
2017-01-18 17:43:48,@Shawhelp is BC ever gonna get SN-W/SN-O in HD? Or SN-E at all?
2017-01-18 17:42:49,@Shawhelp So I subscribe to Sportsnet...And want to watch the jets game (I live in winnipeg) and the only one in my guide is Montreal?
2017-01-18 17:41:37,@Sportsnet @Shawhelp Montreal Pittsburgh have is on instead of Winnipeg Phoenix as on the guide
2017-01-18 17:11:14,"Thanks man, consider it done. (BTW I <3 Shaw + Global. - I refuse to switch to Robers or Hell for TV and Global is best news.)"
2017-01-18 17:00:22,@Shawhelp please tell http:// GolbalTV.com to lower commercial volumes as required by CRTC law in 2012. http://www. crtc.gc.ca/eng/television /publicit/prev.htm …

2017-01-18 15:10:21,"@Shawhelp Nevermind, as soon as I tweeted you it started working again! Weird. Sorry for bugging you."
2017-01-18 15:07:01,@Shawhelp are there internet issues in the South Nanaimo area? Mine's gone down twice since last night.

2017-01-18 14:35:51,Hey @NHL @NHLJets @Shawhelp the NHL app says the jets game is on @Sportsnet west and all I see is Pitts vs Montreal on that channel tonight?

2017-01-18 12:45:57,I did a reset and left unplugged for 2 minutes. did it register?
2017-01-18 12:30:55,"Ok, will try and get back to you"
2017-01-18 12:21:18,I work from home and this is rather interrupting. stops you in your tracks multiple times a day
2017-01-18 12:20:53,"Did it days ago, problem persists. I checked multiple devices (Wifi & Lan) all go offline together, so not local to 1 machine :("

2017-01-18 12:11:46,"hard to check every time given modem's location & short durations of outage,but I've confirmed few times that model was offline"
2017-01-18 12:04:09,@Shawhelp I experience multiple daily outages each lasting seconds to minutes. Please advice
2017-01-18 11:22:53,@Shawhelp cable is not working but the internet is. Tv displays message that says weak or no signal
2017-01-18 11:12:11,definitely

2017-01-18 10:11:59,"Meanwhile, @TELUS @TELUSsupport biggest competitor, @Shawhelp , has had Closed Captioning built into their FreeRange app for years."
2017-01-18 09:57:44,that did not fix it. I will DM you. Thanks
2017-01-18 09:39:42,"@Shawhelp Hi, my cable is not working but internet is. All channels say subscription required but they were all working yesterday. Thanks"

2017-01-17 20:24:51,"getting a ""Latency Test Error"" message now."
2017-01-17 20:23:43,is it the same with our HD box you just unplug it because our TV and Internet has been crawling
2017-01-17 20:22:30,both connections. I've rebooted the modem twice and still really low speeds. Streaming this game is like watching tv in the 60's
2017-01-17 20:20:07,@Shawhelp is there problems with the Internet and cable in the okanagan?
2017-01-17 20:16:44,@Shawhelp are there any issues in Woodlands? I have wave 150 and your speed test (2 done) was 3mbs and the other 22mbs. Can't stream games.
2017-01-17 20:16:15,Well it's listed on your TV guide in my city on your service I pay for. So you have a problem. And in a few years so will the NHL.
2017-01-17 20:13:38,"Ah, so I have to pay more to watch millionaires playing a game that's actually televised but is blocked by other millionaires?"
2017-01-17 20:09:18,Exactly. So I get cable to watch games that they black out. Everything else I can get online. So you have a business model problem
2017-01-17 20:07:32,"Oh, I know what it means. The question is, why do I keep paying you to not watch games? I can not watch games for free."
2017-01-17 20:03:45,TSN blocks SN hockey games so I'm stuck looking at scores. I can check scores on my phone. So what's the point of cable?
2017-01-17 19:57:09,Dear @Shawhelp I'm very sad. My sports channels argue all the time & block each other's best features Is it time to dump cable? Lost in MB
2017-01-17 19:05:58,Uh... I've DM'd... no one seems to be there. Sigh.
2017-01-17 18:45:00,@Shawhelp I have the limited TV pkg. Do I not have access to on demand? Nothing happens when I push the button.
2017-01-17 18:39:03,"@Shawhelp when do episodes go ""on demand""? I'm trying to watch last nights ep of The Bachelor but the ep isn't up on demand yet!"
2017-01-17 18:24:36,"then bring the old modem back, it worked with my camera but this new one doesn't at all"
2017-01-17 18:12:35,"and I'm trying to redo the setup, according to directions from the app....and it's still not working!"
2017-01-17 18:11:52,it is a Dlink DCS-932L
2017-01-17 18:10:48,Yeah!
2017-01-17 18:04:20,lost the camera manual. The camera was working fine until I was given a new modem and now it won't work at all
2017-01-17 17:58:56,"@Shawhelp when trying to connect a wireless camera via Ethernet cable, do I need to hook it up directly to the modem, or laptop?"
2017-01-17 17:57:18,the upload speed is good too!
2017-01-17 17:56:49,"After they got mine up and running with some slower speeds, everything was fixed and I'm beyond happy."
2017-01-17 17:55:33,After dealing with @Shawhelp regarding an internet upgrade I can honestly say I'm a happy customer. Internet 150 is FAST. #NOTSPONSERED
2017-01-17 17:08:39,Actually it came back the SECOND I sent that tweet on my phone. #YoureWelcome ;-) Thanks for the update and help
2017-01-17 17:04:57,Last update on the site was 2:45pm Any word how much longer?
2017-01-17 16:37:08,@Shawhelp as I was given a credit today & they are still harassing me. With the completely incorrect balance. Thanks!
2017-01-17 16:36:05,@Shawhelp can you please ask Payment Solutions to stop sending emails regarding my account? Plus the amount they say is owed is incorrect.
2017-01-17 16:30:31,enabled the hotmail server ( http:// smtp.live.com ) sends it from there fine. #microsoftwins
2017-01-17 16:23:27,thanks. I might end up being a Shaw customer soon if this stupidity from @Tbaytel keeps up! Getting sick of their sh!t
2017-01-17 16:19:49,have anything to do with 'remote access' on the webmail? Then why can I rec and just not send?
2017-01-17 16:18:11,"we wanted POP because we wanted a copy left on server at all times, even after deleting them from our device."
2017-01-17 16:15:28,it did send at one time. Not sure what changed all of a sudden.
2017-01-17 16:15:00,"nope. Same thing. Receives email fine. Cannot send. It did work a week ago, intermittently."
2017-01-17 16:12:01,this happens on both our mobile devices. Can login to webmail fine. Can access it from Outlook on a desktop PC fine.
2017-01-17 16:09:54,That is my only shaw email account that I use
2017-01-17 15:26:43,"It happens almost every night, and it's on YOUR end."

2017-01-17 15:03:02,@Shawhelp For FreeRange TV can parental controls be set to limit time spent on app? And how to disconnect app without the device?

2017-01-17 11:11:08,@ShawInfo 90% of the Internet problems have required a technician. Now our phone is out and you suggest online chat? Really?
2017-01-17 11:09:35,"@ShawInfo well, our phone modem for our business has died and they tell me they can't come to fix it until tomorrow. Dumbfounded."
2017-01-17 11:08:44,@Shawhelp email address switching from my parents account to mine how to do that and would i lose everything currently in my emai?
2017-01-17 10:30:53,I will when I get back home.
2017-01-17 10:07:30,it was a start to a system outage
2017-01-17 09:27:45,"@Shawhelp since there is a service disruption in Dawson creek. And I need internet to do my job, do I get money off my next bill?"
2017-01-17 09:09:40,@Shawhelp any word on the Dawson Creek outage?
2017-01-17 09:07:46,@Shawhelp My cable and internet are out. Is there an outage in #yxj ?
2017-01-17 09:00:04,"I need help, but I have very limited time. I sent aDM"
2017-01-17 08:01:17,@Shawhelp my internet keeps going out. Unplugging isn't working.
2017-01-17 07:12:11,It's not that it can't bring in all the channels. I've had all the channels...for about half a day. I am having to reboot again.
2017-01-17 06:34:51,was fine the last 3 or 4 now it's back to chattering. The box record everything perfect other then Simpson's. Tired of this
2017-01-17 04:31:13,Hey @Shawhelp it would be great if my Internet stopped cutting out in the middle of the night k thanks
2017-01-17 03:07:07,you should be with Telus
2017-01-17 02:03:56,"So sad, isp crapped out on me @Shawhelp anything wrong with north kildonan or east kildonan in winnipeg for Internet ?"
2017-01-17 02:00:19,don't listen to him he's apart of that top 1% #scamartist
2017-01-17 01:32:39,What's wrong with the wifi? @Shawhelp
2017-01-16 23:02:48,you too
2017-01-16 22:40:40,NO....I will not fill out a channel request again. That's Shaw's response? Get with the times. NFL is most watched sport by a mile
2017-01-16 22:28:35,"all is good, your tech was out and looked at it all."
2017-01-16 22:19:44,I've done that twice already. Same result
2017-01-16 22:17:16,it is on the main floor. Same room as smart TV. We also use the laptop mainly in this room. Other 2 are cell phones.
2017-01-16 22:13:45,it ends in 5G
2017-01-16 22:13:25,yes it does
2017-01-16 22:12:13,all 4 devices are WiFi
2017-01-16 22:06:16,@Shawhelp recently upgraded to Internet 150. It came with a new modem. My Internet drops from all devices 3-6 times a day...???
2017-01-16 22:05:53,global
2017-01-16 22:01:58,@Shawhelp Internet is down in South calgary. Router won't stop flashing download light.
2017-01-16 22:01:09,Wired. My router was not getting a WAN IP. A couple reboots appears to have corrected it.
2017-01-16 21:56:58,@Shawhelp is something going on in Langley?? No shaw cable tv or Internet for the last thirty min.
2017-01-16 21:53:13,@Shawhelp Any internet service outages in the Langley area?
2017-01-16 21:40:53,Once again simpsons records with chatter. The other is football at a different time. How much do I pay for this. Please refund @Shawhelp
2017-01-16 21:33:41,OK thanks for checking.
2017-01-16 21:25:19,"hey, it did not work. We are calling 18884722222 pic.twitter.com/Omae9tOMBW"
2017-01-16 21:23:26,"16MB down 0.5 up. (My bill says High Speed, but I don't know what that is. Can you tell? It sure seems slow."
2017-01-16 21:16:54,And yet one of Canada's largest cable providers still does not offer NFL Network in HD. @ShawInfo @Shawhelp #behindthetimes
2017-01-16 21:10:19,I've had to call in the past 3 days. Here's the kicker... #Netflix is coming on my TV via #TELUS Wi-Fi without an issue. Hmmm...
2017-01-16 21:08:44,hello! Thx for the prompt reply. We are on cable box and the loading wheel takes forever. Curl_28 is the error message.
2017-01-16 21:05:28,no split cable go straight from outside to the modem.
2017-01-16 21:03:53,Straight. I had channels until your service asked me to reboot. Missed my show. Watching #Netflix instead. $10 vs. $100...
2017-01-16 21:03:52,@Shawhelp is Shaw on demand down? Communication error is what keeps popping up
2017-01-16 21:01:30,#shawinternet serious problem with @Shawhelp internet. Unusable. Not acceptable service. pic.twitter.com/5ElgknHrqW
2017-01-16 21:00:22,unplugged the modem and cable for 15 min and plugged back. I'm I'm bridge mode. Problem is from shaw side or it's the modem. pic.twitter.com/5trZqcV00P
2017-01-16 20:56:51,And it's the coax cable you sent me with the converter. Service has been unreliable.
2017-01-16 20:56:23,It's tight. I'm watching Knowledge then I switch to CBC and there is no signal for CBC.
2017-01-16 20:54:58,@Shawhelp it's Internet down in Fort McMurray.? My modem been down for the past 2 hrs.
2017-01-16 20:51:19,It's like you watch one station and flip to another and it's gone. It's nuts.
2017-01-16 20:50:19,I had stations until the message told me to unplug it and replug it. Then I lost everything. I'm watching #Netflix now.
2017-01-16 20:49:40,@Shawhelp what's with internet speeds in the north end of Port Coquitlam since this weekend? Must have halved. New subs in the neighborhood?
2017-01-16 20:47:10,@Shawhelp Calling every day since I switched to HDTV. Channels are missing. Error messages on channels that ARE there. Miss #analog .
2017-01-16 20:41:30,@Shawhelp our BlueSky install was cancelled at last minute today. Can you look into the issue?
2017-01-16 20:12:08,@Shawhelp having some internet trouble! Can you dm?
2017-01-16 20:11:28,done. Thanks!
2017-01-16 20:10:12,is it possible to customize the 5min ahead/back to a user defined value? #blueskytv #day1reprogram
2017-01-16 20:09:54,@Shawhelp remote has stopped remoting or receiver is acting up. What's the best way to get this checked out?
2017-01-16 19:34:53,a shared device has popped up on my mac that hasn't been there for the first few weeks of being on this router.
2017-01-16 19:28:12,@Shawhelp I think someone's piggy-backing our router. I've been waiting on your online chat for 20 minutes and I've gotten no response Help?
2017-01-16 19:24:55,"Sorry, but already went through it all with live chat. No options available."
2017-01-16 19:17:13,Useless time spent trying to get my @Shawhelp bill lowered. Why can't I get the cable channels I want instead of ones I'll NEVER watch?
2017-01-16 19:08:38,sadly crtc has allowed cable providers with this type of crap
2017-01-16 19:01:13,will do! My fiancé says no... to spendy for one show!
2017-01-16 18:53:59,aw man. $18 for one channel?! A bit steep. I only need one superchannel. One day a week!
2017-01-16 18:47:08,So I can't buy new episodes of Homeland on iTunes @Shawhelp what do I need to do to order Superchannel and how much will it cost?! 1 show!
2017-01-16 17:50:06,@Shawhelp Why maintenace Al the Time?
2017-01-16 17:49:06,"@shawhelp I'm currently on 2yr agrmnt 150 but have to move to place that already has Shaw inet & TV, but want to keep 150. What are options?"
2017-01-16 17:44:18,"Shaw account, and I'm told username and password not recognized. Confirmed correct info -- I can login to other apps no problem."
2017-01-16 17:36:55,@Shawhelp I haven't been able to log in to the Gateway iPhone app for a few months. Is it dead?
2017-01-16 17:00:08,it was part of my subscription service. But then was removed so I had to subscribe as a pick & pay.
2017-01-16 16:54:03,so I had to subscribe to the big 10 network all over again?!
2017-01-16 16:35:43,"@Shawhelp I wanted to extend my kudos to the tech who attended my home today. Super helpful, friendly and awesome. Thanks!"
2017-01-16 15:39:06,"@Shawhelp hi, the internet was running slow, I have tried to reboost the router, but the problem is remaining"
2017-01-16 14:32:33,"Man, that kid is gonna get bit is the face. #CompSciJokes"
2017-01-16 14:23:34,@Shawhelp is there a reason the jets hockey game is blacked out on the tsngo app I live in the region so it shouldn't be blacked out for me?
2017-01-16 14:18:04,I lost internet for the last hour as well. Definitely something happens in southern Alberta with Shaw internet
2017-01-16 13:36:39,it's all good now!
2017-01-16 13:20:45,@Shawhelp are you guys down in Alberta?
2017-01-16 13:13:24,@Shawhelp really a half hour on hold and nothing?? Cmon hire more than one staff!! pic.twitter.com/sYrsTBbnF0
2017-01-16 12:29:09,@Shawhelp am I able to move my gateway unit to another room? Both rooms have portals already. The fan gets awfully loud sometimes!
2017-01-16 11:49:44,"@Shawhelp Please dm me, wifi not working in the office. Attempted to manually reset several times"

2017-01-16 11:24:46,it's a little better with a direct connect but less than half of what it should be
2017-01-16 11:23:59,"not 100% on that, we can reach out to @Shawhelp and see if they have anything to share ^ZH"
2017-01-16 11:20:17,"@Shawhelp Internet, phone & cable down west of Sooke. Is there an outage?"
2017-01-16 11:19:10,"OK, I did the power reset. I still have wifi connection but no internet access via Ethernet cable. If it helps I have shaw 150mbps"
2017-01-16 10:58:58,"@Shawhelp hello, my internet has stopped working for my PC which is directly wired by ethernet cable. WiFi is still working, what do I do?"
2017-01-16 10:58:52,@Shawhelp Experiencing very slow speeds in Saskatoon over last couple weeks
2017-01-16 09:57:14,"@Shawhelp hey, needed some tech support in vancouver as Internet is down."

2017-01-15 22:10:34,Wired in directly. Cycled the modem/router twice. Speed seems to be fluctuating quite a bit.
2017-01-15 22:09:57,I was picturing this. pic.twitter.com/icYZslEVEB
2017-01-15 22:03:37,I was under the impression the internet was a big truck
2017-01-15 22:01:45,hose? I thought the Internet came through tubes!
2017-01-15 22:00:12,I was putting a kink in the hose.
2017-01-15 21:59:31,@Shawhelp any issues in downtown Edmonton tonight that you know of? getting abysmal speeds.
2017-01-15 21:40:50,I just know that you are all well quick to reply...
2017-01-15 21:38:17,it's back on. I try and adk first as the modem is in my roommate's room.
2017-01-15 21:07:58,@Shawhelp is the internet down in Bankview Calgary?
2017-01-15 20:44:52,@Shawhelp any updates on when 4K content will be available?

2017-01-15 19:56:52,"@Shawhelp just sent a DM with a problem, thanks"
2017-01-15 19:36:00,@Shawhelp hi there are you able to open up more ports for my internet?
2017-01-15 19:33:30,@Shawhelp I switched providers because Telus SUPPORTS globalism but if Shaw keeps advertising CORRUPT CBC on FoxNews I'm CANCELLING Shaw too
2017-01-15 19:01:15,"178 down, 16 up via ethernet. I'll DM you some trace routes."
2017-01-15 18:56:29,Check out these blistering @ShawInfo @Shawhelp internet 30 speeds! So happy to pay $70 a month for this. #sarcasm pic.twitter.com/6MZEbndKOw
2017-01-15 18:52:55,Hey. Also in Lethbridge. Imgur and YouTube have been very slow for a couple of weeks.
2017-01-15 18:47:42,is there a way to tell what it was
2017-01-15 18:39:54,"just added super channel online. It says it takesv24 hours to add! Help, I thought it was immediate. Please assist!"
2017-01-15 18:39:10,@ShawInfo is @WWENetwork via @Shawhelp going to have a on demand service?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
2017-01-15 18:31:22,I did that and now I am getting about 135 d and 15 u - what would have caused the speed to drop
2017-01-15 18:28:04,@Shawhelp is Homeland season 6 available in Winnipeg tonight?
2017-01-15 18:01:48,thanks for getting back to me.
2017-01-15 17:58:58,will do after the game
2017-01-15 17:51:16,@Shawhelp Is the channel 'mediaset' available on shaw yet?
2017-01-15 17:46:16,Hi - yes - more than once.
2017-01-15 17:41:43,just canceled. You wouldn't give me the intro price on the 150 you advertise on your site. Only for new customers. What a joke.
2017-01-15 17:33:58,@Shawhelp guess shaw cares more about new customers than ones that were with them for 5 years. Goodbye shaw.
2017-01-15 16:34:52,it's only one channel that's having the issue. The football feed on CTV isn't having issues but on Fox it is
2017-01-15 16:28:38,just the sound. Picture is fine.
2017-01-15 16:22:39,@Shawhelp any reason why Fox's sound is all staticky/ dropping out. Been like this for a few weeks. Pretty annoying
2017-01-15 16:15:11,Can I get FXX
2017-01-15 16:06:03,Friend has CW but it's on SD chan 60 afaik. Riverdale shows up on that but where is HD option?
2017-01-15 15:07:23,ok cool. Thanks for quick response. If you let me know which network is messing up feed I will angry tweet them
2017-01-15 15:04:21,How come #Riverdale isn’t showing up on an HD channel? Premiere Jan 26 @Shawhelp #YYC @CW_Riverdale #AskingForAFriend
2017-01-15 14:53:20,@Shawhelp Sherwood park cable and internet down. Is this scheduled or unplanned outage?
2017-01-15 14:50:53,it kicked in just after kickoff pic.twitter.com/Vx8fAMtlcK
2017-01-15 14:39:59,I remember it! In SD? Correct?

2017-01-15 11:10:00,@Shawhelp I have an issue where I push my remote button and about 3 or 4 seconds later it takes effect. What's wrong with it?
2017-01-15 11:07:34,oh wow thx
2017-01-15 11:07:15,Chiefs vs. Steelers delayed Kickoff until tonight.

2017-01-14 18:35:10,@Shawhelp just had a less than stellar experience talking to a CS rep on the phone. Who do I talk to about this?
2017-01-14 18:33:14,"I used to be a TSR, so I know exactly how to troubleshoot this. Nothing helps. It's on a temp fix to a bigger problem."
2017-01-14 18:30:35,yes both. I've gone every little thing that I know to do and nothing works.
2017-01-14 18:21:11,@Shawhelp Any reported outages in the Woodlands area of St Albert Ab? Ours is off air.

2017-01-12 15:42:36,"Hmm, direct connection to the modem (from laptop) seems to work just fine. Wired/Wifi is slow from router, suggestions?"

2017-01-12 15:30:49,"Yes, we're running the modem in bridged mode to another router. I tried tethering internet with my phone and it works."
2017-01-12 15:19:29,Both wired and wireless is very slow. Using CMD ping test shows either time out or huge ping for sites like google
2017-01-12 15:14:37,"hi, on chat now with shaw activations but having some trouble. Will let you know how it goes."
2017-01-12 15:07:39,I almost called for help - today I learned an important lesson about the difference between a DPT and Internet Modem...!

2017-01-12 12:19:18,Internet hasn't worked since 930 this morning. Is it an Edmonton issue? We did the reset and everything @Shawhelp
2017-01-12 12:12:20,@Shawhelp It seems like I have to reset our modem at least once or twice a day to get 5 ghz to work.
2017-01-12 12:11:20,@Shawhelp My Shaw modem for some reason reaches a point where it kicks my pic off off 5 ghz wifi. What's going on?
2017-01-12 11:54:09,"sorry, to be clear I'm talking about the Android Apps that allow you access to the X1 gateway via Android devices"
2017-01-12 11:45:34,this is disappointing. The only way to watch Season 4 of the Americans is purchase Apple. Why isn't FX Canada on Shaw on demand?
2017-01-12 11:43:13,@Shawhelp does BlueSky TV support the X1 lineup of apps?
2017-01-12 11:30:18,Hello. I was wondering how long it will take to get Lloyd internet up and running again? Thank you

2017-01-12 11:09:34,ok I will try just to unplug first :)
2017-01-12 11:06:02,"that did the trick, thanks!"
2017-01-12 11:03:34,I'm wondering if it's because of the cold? When my dad gets home I can tell him to try a reset. How would we do that? Unplug?
2017-01-12 11:02:24,"yeah just to get to menu! To change channels, to FF, it's very weird that it to all."
2017-01-12 10:52:31,"hey, sorry about last night. I'm just wondering why my 2 PVRs and 1 cable box are so so laggy."

2017-01-12 08:32:03,"then something's probably wrong with your cables. Get a technician. It's free, you know."
2017-01-12 08:29:26,@Shawhelp Hi folks. Internet is not working at my house this morning. Huge winds last night in Lloydminster and Vermilion. Is the area down?
2017-01-12 08:22:27,"I'll try restarting. It's yours, a Hitron router. If I still have problems I'll call tech support. Just wondered if it was just me"

2017-01-11 23:19:16,what's the point of offering auto payments when you don't take money out & then tell me I'm overdue & you'll take services away?
2017-01-11 23:17:27,Why am I'm being told my payments r overdue but I set up autopayments? isn't it ur job to take my money esp. when I trust you to? @Shawhelp

2017-01-10 22:31:32,"@Shawhelp hi there, I was just wondering what this symbol means? It doesn't say what it is in the help guide pic.twitter.com/JI02uAl0vZ"
2017-01-10 22:29:07,true that!
2017-01-10 22:28:47,@Shawhelp is great. I've taken care of all sorts of account issues through DMs with them. They do Twitter right.
2017-01-10 22:23:09,it's only 9% full. I'll see if the 9pm recording works. Fingers crossed!
2017-01-10 22:20:53,Aaargh @Apple @iTunesMovies why do you hate me tonight? For once it's not an @Shawhelp issue! pic.twitter.com/8cfOqzIuft
2017-01-10 22:14:28,thanks for your quick reply - yep came back on after about 10 mins. Intermittent now - we have some very high winds this evening
2017-01-10 22:13:59,Oh I totally told him to.
2017-01-10 22:12:09,So I had to set it again at 9pm; seeeems to be recording now. 91% free space.
2017-01-10 22:11:31,"First was series, looks like maybe show shifted time slot so time shift recording missed. But manual at 9pm didn't work..."
2017-01-10 22:06:47,"the Hitron has green and blue lights. He said when the purple one was on, they had no wifi -.-;"
2017-01-10 22:04:23,"@Shawhelp 7pm series recording didn't go cause ""cancellation by system"". Set up to record 1 min early at 9. 9pm ...doesn't start."
2017-01-10 22:03:04,"Okay I'll have to try it out once everyone goes to bed, thanks for your time"
2017-01-10 21:35:35,it's split
2017-01-10 21:26:31,"Here you, I've also attached a sample of the ping. It will settle for a while and then return to 1000+ pic.twitter.com/moHyExW4u7"

2017-01-10 21:15:34,@Shawhelp took us 90 seconds of pinholing the modem to get rid of it & for his wifi to start working again. Please advise on that. Thanks!
2017-01-10 21:14:45,@Shawhelp asking for my son. What does it mean when you see a purple light on a Hitron modem? I've never seen one on mine. He has however..

2017-01-10 21:06:46,NOt sure what Shaw DIrect is but...I'm listening..because Bell sure doesn't!!

2017-01-10 20:50:28,
2017-01-10 20:50:21,it's all good. The guide. The times got swapped. Embarrassed I even made a big deal about this ha ha Ha.
2017-01-10 20:49:33,"@Shawhelp I live in Stittsville, ON...do you offer...TV, Internet and Home phone...I am ready to quit my current provider!!!!!"
2017-01-10 20:47:00,@Shawhelp just saw that it was switched for 10pm. #ThisIsUs phew
2017-01-10 20:43:33,Dear @Shawhelp #ThisIsUs is not in even though it's listed. Instead it's Marvel?
2017-01-10 20:41:58,both
2017-01-10 20:32:53,On all tv's? 1 HD and 2 reg def.
2017-01-10 20:25:11,"A few episodes of pixelation, not too many. It's on the std def tv too. Only Seattle stations. CDN stations seem fine."
2017-01-10 20:10:31,he LITERALLY just referred to the oilers as the sharks.
2017-01-10 20:07:55,"HDMI is only on tv with pvr, others are connected by a coax."
2017-01-10 19:55:10,just checked other tv...happens on channels 16 and18.
2017-01-10 19:51:02,Seems to be okay here.
2017-01-10 19:48:27,I'll switch and see here.
2017-01-10 19:40:10,"@Shawhelp Audio is blipping again tonight, channel 202, just like Sunday night. Are there problems with the feed again??"
2017-01-10 19:27:12,Hey @Sportsnet . I think I'm getting the Sharks audio on my @Shawhelp feed. Some Drew guy is complimenting the sharks the whole time.
2017-01-10 19:10:43,I can't deal with this right now. I'm sorry. I am too frustrated and I need to just chill.
2017-01-10 19:07:05,"I hate that I can have Shaw open work fine everywhere, but when I come home my Shaw wifi is glitchy as hell."
2017-01-10 19:02:46,"My dinner is now cold. I am now very frustrated. When I move out in 2 months, I WON'T be getting Shaw. Wifi sucks at home."
2017-01-10 19:02:14,Switched to 202 and still blips in the audio. VERY aggravating!!!
2017-01-10 18:57:54,it does it on that channel on all my boxes and I haven't heard it that bad on other channels
2017-01-10 18:57:48,"@Shawhelp That's awesome & all, but a suggestion about how to decrease the interference to the 2.4ghz. would be great =) https:// twitter.com/Shawhelp/statu s/818993367895797760 …"
2017-01-10 18:53:19,@Shawhelp Hey is it normal for Channel 82 @FOXTV Spokane to be making a popping sound? (That's the Winnipeg Channel Number)
2017-01-10 18:52:42,I can't unscrew it from the wall outlet. It's on top tight
2017-01-10 18:51:05,Hey @Shawhelp you know what's not nice. Removing the coax from the telephone pole to my house... #weneededthat
2017-01-10 18:51:02,what is the coax cable?
2017-01-10 18:49:12,what's a coax cable?
2017-01-10 18:47:03,"I hate @Telus , but I am super close to switching to them when I move....As long as I can have wifi that works all the time."
2017-01-10 18:46:05,I just unplugged the modem. The wall outlet is hard to get to
2017-01-10 18:45:33,this problem happens all too often for my liking. Wifi cuts out at least once a week. Sometimes unplugging the modem works fine.
2017-01-10 18:42:08,"@Shawhelp our wifi keeps cutting out. I have unplugged the modem 3 times now. It then works for a brief time, before cutting out again"
2017-01-10 18:24:23,Now happening on channel 200 during KOMO news from Seattle!!
2017-01-10 18:18:06,@Shawhelp 5G internet isn't working why?
2017-01-10 18:15:53,"I would love to be able to connect solely to the 2.4ghz. It's not possible with some of these devices. Otherwise, I would."
2017-01-10 18:04:37,The devices we use on the 2.4ghz do not have the option to switch to the 5ghz. Weekends and evenings are the absolute worst.
2017-01-10 18:03:40,It's the 2.4ghz we have the most interference on. I change the channels multiple times a day now and we constantly have drops.
2017-01-10 17:56:38,Hey @Shawhelp just a quick tweet to say I just had the best upgrade/install experience ever with your Vancouver installer named Nelson.
2017-01-10 17:47:11,I guess that'll cur-tail my streaming tonight. Cheers for the help!
2017-01-10 17:35:46,"Right in the center, actually. Thanks for shed-ing some light on the situation! Any ETA on the repair?"
2017-01-10 17:21:29,My internet; the WAN on my Hitron isn't locking. Perhaps the CM fur-got the QAM carrier?
2017-01-10 17:18:44,hello there. Nothing. No microwaves no baby monitors nothing. :/
2017-01-10 17:18:28,Boston Vs. St. Louis

2017-01-10 17:09:46,Just sent a DM. Problem persisting.
2017-01-10 17:05:49,@Shawhelp Hey! Is there an outage in Downtown Saskatoon right meow?
2017-01-10 16:34:29,already spent my day with tech support. Its the Hitron router and everyone knows it. Get a new brand!
2017-01-10 16:30:39,"Have you upgraded to the Shaw 150? Do you have a Hitron router? If so, that is the problem."
2017-01-10 16:27:39,@Shawhelp FYI your Hitron router for Internet 150 is a disaster. Admit its a problem and get a new router to customers #shawwifi #fixit
2017-01-10 15:22:35,"@Shawhelp is shaw down at the moment? I have no cable, internet or dial tone on my home phone"
2017-01-10 15:18:41,still sucks. I'm just not seeing the speeds I had before. App on LTE is fine. Just wifi sucks. Yet Speedtest ok. Puzzling.
2017-01-10 15:00:39,ok! It seems better- I'll know over time I guess. Thanks for the suggestion!
2017-01-10 14:35:25,"only when accessed thru Twitter. Faster thru Safari. Weird. Did a speed test, getting speeds as good as the router can handle."
2017-01-10 14:24:28,"Is Shaw throttling Twitter? I can hardly use it on phone wifi. Twitter is pretty low bandwidth @Shawhelp . If I go to LTE, no problems."
2017-01-10 14:24:11,@Shawhelp Do you guys have any advanced wifi modems stronger than the Hitron? The daily channel changing is getting on my nerves.
2017-01-10 14:23:28,@Shawhelp Shaw we're moving from bby to coq and have been told we can't keep our phone number we've had for 20y. Is this true?
2017-01-10 14:19:14,"@Shawhelp We've completely lost all services. No internet, no dial tone, and no cable TV. This suddenly happened about 20mins ago."

2017-01-09 19:41:46,@Shawhelp why does my internet stop working once a week and require a phone call to shaw support for a reset every time (~1hr)?

2017-01-06 16:28:03,Already called in. Very frustrated. Have to wait for tech on Monday.
2017-01-06 16:01:06,"Ok, so after months of no issues, it seems my ISP @Shawhelp has throttled my connection whether their crappy router or tech error."
2017-01-06 15:44:04,@Shawhelp would be nice to see an unsubscribe in your marketing emails.

2017-01-05 20:48:47,. We just started our internet with you guys last week and now so not happy at all and in a 2 year contract.
2017-01-05 20:44:36,wired in directly
2017-01-05 20:36:34,"you fixed the same issue in 10 min what @TELUSsupport hasn't been able to in over 13 hrs - believe me, you'll be getting a call"
2017-01-05 20:31:07,I am experiencing even slower speeds now. 7 down 5 up. Less ping though.

2017-01-05 20:18:34,@Shawhelp do you have student pricing for your internet packages? I can't seem to find in 'offers.'
2017-01-05 20:09:05,i found it happening more during rounds but it still is most likely the same issue
2017-01-05 20:06:38,also this likely isn't a local issue i am from Manitoba and my friends i disconnected with simultaneously were from BC and Alberta
2017-01-05 20:06:37,"I know quite a few others who are experiencing this as well. it's always random, more often when the round starts/ends"

2017-01-05 20:00:56,No problems with game connection until 2 days ago. but having multiple shaw users disconnect at the same time is no coincidence

2017-01-05 11:51:25,Speeds are now restored but it had nothing to do with anything on this side. Your service always has disruptions at midnight.

2017-01-05 11:12:11,@Shawhelp I just had a tech here and put in a new modem. It's telling me my password is incorrect now. Help pls

2017-01-05 10:26:03,I've corrected @TELUS probably 7 times on my name spelling and it's still wrong. These ads alone are enough to make me switch to @Shawhelp
2017-01-05 10:17:10,. @Shawhelp been there done that. You could try asking your agents to make the last three return calls promised. #SoDone
2017-01-05 10:14:14,ah thanks! That seemed to do the trick.

2017-01-01 09:05:26,@Shawhelp I heard that MAVTV will be available in Canada soon. Any details? Can it be added to basic package?
2017-01-01 08:38:25,ya it's my shaw account. The usage goes goes up but the cap is still at 150. Not a major issue was just curious. I'll DM you
2017-01-01 08:25:33,@Shawhelp changed to internet 150 yesterday. Website says I get 1 TB of data but my shaw says I still have 150G of usage. Is this correct?

2017-01-01 01:04:58,I think @Shawhelp should pay for our 2017 internet and tv since they were down at our place for the countdown. That's really not fair
2017-01-01 00:39:01,@Shawhelp hi there. Any idea when the outage on the west side of Vanc will be repaired

2016-12-30 20:51:42,I do not want to watch the remaining fights (missed 1st completely). Asked for 20% (1/5 fights) refund or cancel charge. Told no.

2016-12-30 20:04:53,How come a $49.99 PPV is a one click purchase but a $4.99 movie on VOD I get asked 3 times if I Want to buy? Extremely shocked @Shawhelp
2016-12-30 20:01:58,just wish @ShawInfo would offer better bundles 4 @ShawDirect customers with #Shaw Cable #Internet @Shawhelp (reason haven't switched phone)

2016-12-30 19:38:04,alrighty. Thanks for the assistance.
2016-12-30 19:30:57,same outlet for both. It keeps going off for 5 mins at a time and then back online.
2016-12-30 19:22:52,@Shawhelp what's going on Calgary Beltline? My cable and internet keep cutting out.
2016-12-30 19:19:32,"VM is working now. We reset 2-3 weeks ago, for the 4th time this year. Long story -- ending now."
2016-12-30 19:08:05,Cool. We're back on line. Any word on why our VM is disabled tri-monthly?
2016-12-30 18:52:49,"@shawinfo So, no word on VM issue yet. Now phone is offline. Does this mean you've given up and cancelled our line? #idcallbut ..."
2016-12-30 18:06:12,"Already did, and no they don't. #SinkingShip"
2016-12-30 17:55:24,That's what I thought - more money... Forget it! So sorry for you... :-(
2016-12-30 17:48:38,"Options meaning more cost to me? No thanks, I'm more inclined to drop you in that case. Please explain ""options""."
2016-12-30 17:44:51,And does that make sense? I either have the channel or I don't... Just like you either have a customer or you don't.
2016-12-30 17:37:59,'splain me this: I get Big Ten SD (157) but not Big Ten HD (232). I rarely watch it but when I do I hate your ugly SD. Same show!
2016-12-30 17:17:58,"the thing with IMAP is we want 2people access the same acct & when you delete from either phone, to still have a copy on server."
2016-12-30 16:44:22,"well they must be because it works 60% of the time. Only does this intermittently, I thought maybe server issues?"
2016-12-30 16:30:49,"I do, Just tried it again and now it sent (of course). Something about ""cannot reach server"" I think, but hotmail works fine."
2016-12-30 16:25:07,@Shawhelp hey what gives? Email (pop) send/receive only works part time on my Shaw acct on our iPhones .... then randomly will work...

2016-12-30 13:23:23,I would like to mention I realize you can't make WiFi 100 perfect. But even 50 percent would suffice.
2016-12-30 13:22:41,while I appreciate the link to your website.. I used to be a TSR. I've done everything 7+ times and nothing resolves the issue.
2016-12-30 13:11:05,@ShawInfo @Shawhelp where do we go in #yyc to exchange box/remotes? Still go to place on 32nd ne? Thanks

2016-12-29 20:49:41,@TELUS tv is pretty solid bro. And they always have specials when NFL Sunday ticket comes around
2016-12-29 20:48:03,"it will drop for a few minutes, then its slow, then it's good. We've had the modem changed a few times now."
2016-12-29 20:42:00,@Shawhelp my internet stops working almost every night after 5pm. What can I do cause your tech support clearly has no answers for me.
2016-12-29 20:21:54,Do you guys not have 4k? @Shawhelp ... I just bought a 4k tv.... @TELUSsupport got it?

2016-12-29 19:23:09,pay you guys over $200 a month for the past 2 years I complain about my net and i get nothing from you its never fixed
2016-12-29 19:21:43,@Shawhelp Two years not its been like this two years I have been paying for what im not getting you do realize i can sue you for this?
2016-12-29 19:10:33,oh shocker its now moderate nat too

2016-12-29 19:05:29,WHY is there league restrictions when i'm signed ito my shaw account i can't watch the oilers game?! the fuck is this? @Shawhelp
2016-12-29 18:59:03,. Hmm. Ok. That's going to get annoying. #Shaw has traditionally led the way when it comes to apps.
2016-12-29 18:58:53,They've got a small box that only outputs coax and RCA. A new TV only has HDMI input.
2016-12-29 18:52:28,@ShawHelp Have some questions about someone with a digital to analog converter and a new TV. Is this the right place?
2016-12-29 18:51:20,. It works fine. All I was asking is if it's going to be updated so the message stops coming up everytime I open the app.
2016-12-29 18:22:49,. I would assume the message saying iPhone would have made it obvious.
2016-12-29 17:49:24,Apparently it has been intermittent since yesterday morning. I'm attempting to reset and power down.
2016-12-29 17:40:39,"@Shawhelp . Are you guys going to be updating the Gateway app? I've been getting this message, when I open the app, for a few months now. pic.twitter.com/OcGUtXHaXo"
2016-12-29 17:38:10,@Shawhelp Internet down in Richmond BC area?
2016-12-29 17:32:51,thanks
2016-12-29 17:30:37,@Shawhelp your cable box/pvr thing sucks and i hate you
2016-12-29 17:24:10,@Shawhelp just installed my brand new modem. On the display there's a 2.4G light & 5G light. What's the difference?
2016-12-29 17:19:00,"awesome, sending now!"
2016-12-29 17:15:03,@Shawhelp is there any way to verify this is true? Thanks! 2/2
2016-12-29 17:14:38,"@Shawhelp Hey, thinking of switching to you, but your website is telling me service is unavailable at my address, but is @my neighbours1/2"
2016-12-29 17:13:57,"WiFi, we don't use the hard line"
2016-12-29 17:01:16,it was on 1. We have switched it to 6. Will let you know
2016-12-29 16:59:11,"negative we are in Temple NE, Internet running very slow and Internet keeps dropping"
2016-12-29 16:53:03,@Shawhelp anyone else experiencing Internet problems in #yyc #calgary
2016-12-29 16:49:49,"regular browsing as well, but especially noticeable when playing games that are more strict towards connection. happens all day"
2016-12-29 16:31:28,tried another speed test. Download speed got to 0.65 before it timed out.
2016-12-29 16:26:03,did that and it was fine but now it's slow again
2016-12-29 15:55:51,the modem doesn't appear to change. Wireless only. Not sure it is disconnecting but it is slow enough to time out websites
2016-12-29 15:48:31,@Shawhelp are you having issues with Internet today? Connection seems to come and go without logical explanation.
2016-12-29 15:45:04,"http:// beta.speedtest.net/result/5922240 404 … After switching to the 5G connection. Much better, thanks! @shawhelp"

2016-12-29 15:09:42,That is on wireless

2016-12-29 14:33:46,it's definitely something on your guys' end
2016-12-29 14:33:23,@Shawhelp can you explain why I'm getting consistent lag spikes daily? its unbearable
2016-12-29 14:28:24,"Thanks, how soon should I expect to get a reply from you?"
2016-12-29 14:20:41,seriously- the tech was so patient & informative! Best channel lesson ever
2016-12-29 14:19:41,> @Finnas_13 @Shawhelp Agreed. One of the reasons I stayed w/ Shaw!
2016-12-29 14:11:45,@Shawhelp - you ROCK! And you have the most lovely patient tech support. Thank you
2016-12-29 14:10:23,@NETGEAR - if there was a live person to talk to I wouldn't have deleted you. Security update = crashed internet = hello @Shawhelp

2016-12-29 10:00:10,"Well, work faster... I'm thinking of ditching tv... 4K is here and you still have SD channels that I want in HD... #TooLate ?"
2016-12-29 09:49:57,"I didn't get the present I was hoping for: FoxNewsHD... What HD channels did you add this month, and what's planned for Jan 2017?"

2016-12-29 01:29:35,@Shawhelp my wifi isn't working. What to do?
2016-12-28 23:50:01,"Shaw ""welcome home"" plan is a huge scam! Tricks and loads of fine print. Shaw you have lost my business. @Shawhelp"
2016-12-28 23:13:19,@Shawhelp Every single night my internet speeds drops to unusable when I pay for 75 down. Tonight only the 5G one is using as well.
2016-12-28 22:20:04,NOT impressed with Shaw cable @Shawhelp Charging ridiculous installation fees after an expensive product is purchased.

2016-12-26 21:54:46,Thanks for all the great help this evening. So basically no streaming on ABC/CBS/NBC/FOX/PBS. Right?
2016-12-26 21:54:37,"@Shawhelp good work, system is up & running!"

2016-12-26 21:48:27,"OK. Got it going ^BE. Took three tries. No American channels included, right? No ABC/CBS etc. but do see CNN add-on."
2016-12-26 21:43:33,Got past the login obstacle. That then brings up: Whitelabel Error Page. So looks to be a no go on a Chromebook.

2016-12-26 21:32:47,@Shawhelp any outages in the Surrey area? Ping and internet are a little hit and miss
2016-12-26 21:30:45,"@Shawhelp can you confirm outages in Campbell River, first my Internet stopped, cable box boot cylced now has no ip, phone still works"
2016-12-26 21:27:17,@Shawhelp any update on the service outage in Campbell River? Wanted to watch a movie with the family

2016-12-26 21:17:36,Thanks. Noticing though that I can't sign in to Freerange on the Chromebook through that URL. Continue button not active.
2016-12-26 21:06:42,@Shawhelp Is Shaw FreeRange able to run on a Chromebook or is it strictly app-based for i-devices and Android devices?

2016-12-26 20:09:06,using all my cell phone data because of something that techs have basically said and troubleshoot on your end is unacceptable

2016-12-25 16:50:43,I had never heard of this until I checked the router log - constant interruptions of service seem to coincide with attacks
2016-12-25 16:45:58,I have read that article. What settings should I use on the Cisco 3825 router wifi to solve this?
2016-12-25 16:40:19,@Shawhelp what can I do to stop SYN flood attacks?

2016-12-15 10:25:55,@shawinfo @shawhelp been noticing a lot of maintenance in the Vancouver area recently. What are you up to?
2016-12-15 10:03:36,I think that @Shawhelp WiFi is the single worst network implementation in the bloody world.
2016-12-15 09:36:10,I think it was just our office and I've got it back! Thanks anyways guys!
2016-12-15 09:35:55,"Thanks. Sadly, the market is flooded with your cable boxes. I guess mine have just had their time."
2016-12-15 09:25:14,@Shawhelp are there any issues in downtown Vancouver at the moment?
2016-12-15 09:15:18,"will try but what about mamma? Very sad mommy here. Missing my shows! 5 days is sooooo long, to long. #shawtv"

2016-12-15 08:54:04,Seriously have to wait now until Tuesday to get someone out 2 fix our box? @Shawhelp #shawtv so long to have NO TV with teens too. 2 long
2016-12-15 08:51:59,"@Shawhelp any issues with gateway service in the TriCities this morning? I got nothing but ""an error occurred""."
2016-12-15 08:47:03,Sorry doesn't cut it.No $ 4 heat auto and gas. Liberals r out of touch No 2 Carbon *
2016-12-15 08:42:46,I don't have any idea what I am supposed to do with my old cable boxes since I cancelled TV service. Recycle them? Suggestions @Shawhelp ?
2016-12-15 08:26:21,^Harvey service outage in North Van last night. Resolved but my router was cooperating. One of your chat techs solved it.
2016-12-15 08:25:41,here at home nope but at work they are...I am no longer at work :) so doesn't affect me
2016-12-15 07:41:09,@Shawhelp Is there still a service outage in North Van? Appears to be going on 12 hours now.
2016-12-15 07:40:30,"@Shawhelp Do you know of any Shaw issues in Thunder Bay, Ontario, this morning? Possibly affecting businesses? Saying numbers not in service"
2016-12-15 06:09:36,happened again just now. Msg on tv says 'cannot communicate with the Shaw Gateway. pls check your cable connections. annoying
2016-12-15 05:14:14,I have my account information but not sure how to do a private message.... please advise.
2016-12-15 04:14:33,What is the point of being awake if there is no TV or Internet at my house? Guess I will go to sleep now. @Shawhelp
2016-12-15 04:01:14,@ShawInfo 3AM... still offline... why orange instead of red now? curious... #shawcable #internetoutage pic.twitter.com/vL9db4IWOz
2016-12-15 03:17:26,major ongoing outage with @Shawhelp for at least the past hour... hope issue is soon resolved pic.twitter.com/JfqyZZ3Unw
2016-12-15 03:05:24,@Shawhelp don't advertise 150mbs down and 50 up. I can barely get 48 down and 15 up. Good thing I have 15 days to cancel.
2016-12-15 01:11:24,just signed up for @Shawhelp . Disappointed there's no @CTVNews Channel HD in #vancouver
2016-12-15 00:16:13,It looks like my isp is getting some outages. And I can't stream because of it. @Shawhelp #cannotstream #twitch
2016-12-14 23:16:17,no splitter. The other day the channels were reading normally on this tv. All the other tv's in the house work fine
2016-12-14 22:50:54,"@Shawhelp 1- Wifi very slow since this morning. 2- All channels on cable read ""not available"" but work. Solutions?"

2016-12-14 22:15:21,it would be nice if there was some integration with the @AMC_TV app.
2016-12-14 22:14:07,Any idea when? I believe @TELUS offers beIN sports channel
2016-12-14 22:09:06,"And you say I can't edit what displays on the guide, so nothing to do about it. And it is OK for other channels."
2016-12-14 22:07:41,@Shawhelp does shaw offer the beIN sports channel?
2016-12-14 22:07:09,"... I have to look at 23 for TSN1, 182-185 for 2-5 and if I happen to be in the 200's on the guide, it's only 3-5 on 238-240."
2016-12-14 22:05:48,"Not the actual channels location, just not being able to see all 5 TSNs 181-185 or 236-240. Now to see all 5 TSNs on the guide..."
2016-12-14 22:05:02,"@Shawhelp Does Shaw insert "" http:// opinionsurveygroup.net "" surveys into shaw user browsers? Or is this a malicious content thing?"
2016-12-14 22:01:54,I know. The problem is having to skip 159 channels in the guide to see what is on TSN1 and TSN2. But u say it can't be helped.
2016-12-14 21:52:15,"Mostly it's a good thing. But TSN1 lists on 23. In order to see TSN2 I have to go to 182, but can't see TSN1 at 181."
2016-12-14 21:42:44,that's the ultimate insult to folllow up on pants customer service.
2016-12-14 21:32:36,Dear @Shawhelp it's Wednesday already and the latest Walking Dead ep is still NOT on the Free Range app. Why does it take so long?
2016-12-14 21:27:44,"@Shawhelp Is there any way to change the channels that the guide displays? Showing received channels only is mostly good, but PITA for TSN."
2016-12-14 21:18:17,I can't dm you
2016-12-14 21:13:36,"This is such a joke. I received this modem 2 weeks ago and it is pathetically slow, I was told it would be better."
2016-12-14 21:11:09,nothing is working - I disconnected everything multiple times I keep getting error code s0a00

2016-12-14 18:19:05,oh thanks for writing me! Yes it's definitely not faster than what was advertised
2016-12-14 17:56:41,If you could get me off of hold with Telus so I can cancel my services that would be great. :D
2016-12-14 17:35:11,Also says DVR service unavailable.
2016-12-14 17:32:12,we only have 1 TV at he moment.

2016-12-14 17:09:54,@Shawhelp are there outage issues in Glenbrook SW #yyc ?
2016-12-14 17:09:28,The @sign computer sign 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz signs are all blinking if that helps.
2016-12-14 17:08:34,Internet is the only service I have with Shaw. The cable is directly into the wall. the modem I'm using the hitron modem
2016-12-14 17:06:44,I will if there is no improvement... thanks!
2016-12-14 17:04:31,yes and the issue has not gone away. Almost been 24 hours now. Any other tips?
2016-12-14 17:01:34,"YouTube, Netflix etc all seem to have no trouble streaming..."
2016-12-14 16:58:38,NW of Calgary. issues are for both wired and wireless. Also on multiple computers.
2016-12-14 16:55:37,@Shawhelp I pay for 15 download internet and I'm only getting .5 right now... is there an issue on your side of things currently?
2016-12-14 16:52:44,"Weird again. Went out came back, 2 downloaded fast and then slow again... I don't get it."
2016-12-14 16:23:36,"It was the whole neighbourhood having the same problem, it's all good now though. Probably the cold weather! :)"
2016-12-14 16:21:43,we are paying for a service!We should be able to view all on demand shows in their proper vibrancy! Not happy with your suggestion

2016-12-14 16:10:13,"treehouse and family jr on demand. Peppa pig, and now yo gabbagabba"
2016-12-14 16:08:08,@Shawhelp the shaw on demand shows are really dull - live tv is vibrant. Our 3 year old thinks it's an old show lol! What's going on?!
2016-12-14 16:01:05,That is correct! We've unplugged the modem for a minute and it still doesn't seem to work
2016-12-14 15:24:09,"The lights that appear are Power, DS, US, Online and Ethernet 1 is flashing"
2016-12-14 15:14:35,@Shawhelp Hi! Is there any issues happening in Northwest Calgary? Specifically the Hidden Valley area ? Can't seem to connect to internet
2016-12-14 15:09:57,it would upgrade 20 apps in like 3 minutes never mind 1 app in 10. :(
2016-12-14 15:09:35,I did run a speed test and it seemed fine. Just frustrating as since I upgraded this has never been an issue until now.
2016-12-14 15:07:10,guess just gotta hope this is a Apple Store/iTunes glitch because it's definitely frustrating.
2016-12-14 15:05:29,currently downloading upgrade for FB app. 184.9MB - gonna take 11 minutes. Ridiculous.
2016-12-14 15:01:06,fix if it's an apple issue. Internet seems to be working otherwise but the whole point of this extreme speed is for speed... :(
2016-12-14 15:00:29,Well it's still saying it will take minutes to download each app which normally take seconds. Very frustrating. Not sure how to
2016-12-14 14:58:50,@Shawhelp Shaw Open wifi so slow can't even play a YouTube video
2016-12-14 14:37:47,@Shawhelp why are you taking away our webspace? Only reason we stayed with Shaw. We'll be looking to see what #Telus has to offer now.
2016-12-14 14:28:25,@Shawhelp how come the @nflnetwork still isn't available in HD? Every other provider has it in HD
2016-12-14 14:09:34,"Hey, so apparently this was fixed overnight. What was the issue?"
2016-12-14 14:06:58,early 2017? it seems odd its taking this long since passpoint work on android in so many other places globally.
2016-12-14 13:41:43,@Shawhelp hey whats up with android freedom mobile users being able to use the shaw passpoint wifi and shaw android users not being able to?
2016-12-14 13:39:25,I've already looked that over.... I thought contacting you directly would help solve the issue
2016-12-14 13:27:36,"Tried all 3 options, essentially same volume level."
2016-12-14 13:23:54,this is a never-ending issue that constantly plagues me. my new connection doesnt let me add it to my profile so cant pay

2016-12-13 20:38:54,like seriously software upgrade on Mac is taking 30 minutes for 1.3GB? That usually downloads in a minute.
2016-12-13 20:37:57,tried that already. Didn't help. Super duper slow on MacBook and phone too yet it's saying speed is normal on test.

2016-12-12 13:34:22,Modem? Or main box?
2016-12-12 13:27:38,"Phone, Internet /wifi are Shaw account. Should I restart main box in the house ?"
2016-12-12 13:13:14,@Shawhelp Is there problem with Internet in Winnipeg now?
2016-12-12 13:04:09,"@Shawhelp So this is weird, my pvr says I've used 30% of space, but I've hardly anything saved on it. When I delete stuff it still says 30%"

2016-12-12 11:53:00,@Shawhelp are you experience outages with phones lines at 178 Street & 81 Ave in YEG? Cause my home phone isn't working
2016-12-12 11:37:56,"@Shawhelp WTF?! Y'all shut off my cable/internet. I went in and PAID. Internet got reconnected, but y'all screwed me on my cable?? WTF?!"
2016-12-12 11:32:39,Thanks. Happy Holidays
2016-12-12 11:24:58,It's about a merchant who stole money from a @ShawFloors Account with Synchrony Bank @SYFNews @AskSynchrony
2016-12-12 11:20:40,Hello...Having problems still. We reconnected it as you said and internet is still super slow :(
2016-12-12 11:20:03,@Shawhelp Do you help with Shaw flooring issues? Thanks
2016-12-12 11:16:37,thanks!

2016-12-12 11:10:22,Hola - I'll try that when I'm back home - I'm also going to pick up a USB Ethernet adapter tonight - hopefully that will help.
2016-12-12 11:06:47,@Shawhelp in St. Albert. Certain channels are showing a message saying No Content - Zach
2016-12-12 11:02:34,This is going to be a problem - my Ethernet port isn't working on my computer. So I can't connect a cord to my computer.
2016-12-12 10:59:47,I would like speak to someone about my experience
2016-12-12 10:56:24,@Shawhelp hi there. Is there a connection issue in Richmond BC?
2016-12-12 10:32:43,Hey @ShawInfo or @Shawhelp ... when do we get Cooking Channel? :)
2016-12-12 10:30:25,"It's fixed! Probably internal, all the cisco ceiling things were blinking orange but power cycling the modem seemed to reset."
2016-12-12 10:25:16,fixed!
2016-12-12 10:17:52,@Shawhelp any internet outages in downtown VIctoria? Our office is down at Douglas and Yates.
2016-12-12 10:17:04,that did the trick. Thanks so much and sorry for not responding sooner. Have a great day!
2016-12-12 09:00:06,I've been having the same issue for days. Tried changing the Wifi channel and had no success.
2016-12-12 08:44:28,"@Shawhelp All services down again. Can you look into this, please?"
2016-12-12 08:41:29,Thanks. I am with @Telus now. I ran through your site and see much better options but final price will be similar.
2016-12-12 08:23:51,@Shawhelp why is there no signal past 1/2 hr?
2016-12-12 07:59:59,"@Shawhelp What's up with WiFi - I keep getting a ""connection timeout occurred"" incredibly frustrating, fix it ASAP!!"
2016-12-11 23:36:35,"@Shawhelp getting terrible service here in edmonton. constant drops of service, high ping to all test servers. 18upload, 0.2download."
2016-12-11 21:41:10,"yes, looks like tomorrow, you should update as things progress or not."
2016-12-11 21:38:39,"@Shawhelp BIG shoutout to Keith @Southgate Mall in AB for help with my bill this weekend, & for understanding 20 years is worth something"
2016-12-11 21:34:29,I received in the mail that I will need a replacement wifi modem.
2016-12-11 21:29:44,"I'm back to the ""signal loss detected"" message."
2016-12-11 21:26:49,and reconnected
2016-12-11 21:25:25,Just disconnected
2016-12-11 21:18:02,Both Arris. No other devices.
2016-12-11 21:11:14,"There is. One goes to the main DVR, the other to the Arris TV component."
2016-12-11 21:08:37,"No luck. Disconnecting the cable resulted in a ""disconnected cable"" message. I rebooted all the boxes again and I'm back to sq 1."
2016-12-11 20:57:48,Done. It's rebooting now.
2016-12-11 20:54:09,Only have the 1.
2016-12-11 20:52:39,"Programming info comes in, though. Although no channel logos."
2016-12-11 20:51:56,"Just TV. All channels show ""This channel is not currently being broadcast, or there is a problem with receiving the signal"""
2016-12-11 20:51:06,"@Shawhelp #uncool 2 days no internet, phone or tv. And, 28 mins wasted on hold for me to contact you for an update."
2016-12-11 20:47:59,Not unless its spread quite a bit. :) That's the east edge of the city. I'm just south of downtown core.
2016-12-11 20:42:11,DCX3510-M is the PVR. connected to 1 tv.
2016-12-11 20:41:56,"@Shawhelp Is there an outage in the Calgary Mission area? Been up and down all day, now its just down. Already power cycled Arris box twice."
2016-12-11 20:12:51,finally got it. Had to enter it twice after a restart. Thx

2016-12-11 20:03:19,"Nah, your feed was on SNW when it should've been SNOilers, folks watching online missed most of the 1st period."
2016-12-11 19:58:20,"@shawhelp Just FYI, your freerangeTV app is not showing the Oilers vs Jets game."
2016-12-11 19:45:59,I will if I actually get service but I'm our my Sunday afternoon on my day off. Apparently following through is too much to ask
2016-12-11 19:45:33,"not working after full reset through router, any other ideas?"
2016-12-11 19:35:50,"after the power cycle it works, any idea on what to try to fix the router?"
2016-12-11 19:31:49,@Shawhelp whenever I change the channel the audio takes 4-5 seconds to come on. & It's usually out of sync as well. Takes pausing to fix.
2016-12-11 19:24:18,@Shawhelp is Internet down for T2T1W7?
2016-12-11 19:22:57,straight from modem to computer and it is still not working

2016-12-11 19:02:16,"still not working, the cable from that splitter also goes to my tv which is working normally so the splitter is working it seems"
2016-12-11 18:55:05,yea there's a splitter
2016-12-11 18:48:06,tried the steps in the correct order and still not working

2016-12-11 17:43:01,"4. Consecutive error that Shaw has made on our account! Guys! We like you, but working with you has been really hard lately! @Shawhelp"
2016-12-11 17:41:56,I bought it new a bit less then 3 years ago. I am having the same speed issues on my phone and my PS4 as well.
2016-12-11 17:41:47,"3. Anyway, we're still waiting for this call and this whole fiasco is causing so much stress b/c this is the fourth or fifth @Shawhelp"
2016-12-11 17:40:16,"2. That our bill was indeed wrong, and that he didn't have the ability to change the codes. He said so some would call us... @Shawhelp"
2016-12-11 17:39:09,"1. Hi @Shawhelp , a rep screwed up in our bill. Overcharged us $100 from the deal we were quoted. Anyway, we called yesterday. Grant told us"
2016-12-11 17:38:32,@Shawhelp Hi. Does Shaw currently have a fireplace channel for the holidays?

2016-12-11 17:16:04,yes all solid
2016-12-11 17:15:40,@Shawhelp our wifi isn't working. Are there problems around lougheed and government st?
2016-12-11 17:12:22,"After I plugged it back in all the lights immediately came back on except phone 1 and phone 2, they stayed off. If that helps."
2016-12-11 17:11:10,@Shawhelp I notice that the 150 plan is now pegged at $100 after the two-year term. Is this down from a previously listed $130?
2016-12-11 17:10:16,speed test from safemode?
2016-12-11 17:09:10,None of the landlines are working. I tried to unplug the phone modem and plug it back in but it hasn't worked.
2016-12-11 17:00:10,no I only have the one.

2016-12-11 16:44:10,no there isn't
2016-12-11 16:38:39,yeah I do that several times a day. I had actually just done that before I took the speed test.

2016-12-06 21:44:50,@Shawhelp @FOXTV why is fox having a statically like sound? I've turned my Shaw box on and off but hasn't worked.

2016-12-06 20:42:54,. @Shawhelp my wifi is basically useless and we have the top internet package. What's up?
2016-12-06 20:33:18,Felt the love on Twitter today from @TELUSsupport and @Shawhelp
2016-12-06 20:23:12,". @Shawhelp Currently with #telus , paying $150/mth for brutally slow internet and a bunch of channels I don't watch. Can you do better?"
2016-12-06 20:18:35,and that's where tv providers are dropping the ball. Oh well.
2016-12-06 20:18:12,@Shawhelp sent you another message
2016-12-06 20:05:56,and can you do that without an existing package?
2016-12-06 20:05:13,"I do it's set up for tomorrow, thank you!"
2016-12-06 20:01:03,it's gone
2016-12-06 19:48:08,@Shawhelp when is Shaw going to allow customers to pick & pay for individual channels & not be stuck with a package?
2016-12-06 19:41:24,ok cool. Phew. Thanks Ken!
2016-12-06 19:38:39,"but even for 15Mbps, can I get a cap > 300Tb per month?"
2016-12-06 19:37:49,"not running a business, contributing & distributing OSS. Business would be $300+/mo for starters, waaaaay out of my budget."
2016-12-06 19:35:27,but my pvr symbol looks weird. It's four lines with a blue dot. Weird
2016-12-06 19:34:54,oh I think they're back!
2016-12-06 19:29:59,"it's hanging out on ""one moment please...."""
2016-12-06 19:27:09,"sorry, my initial tweet’s calculation was off: cap > 2Tb per Mb of upload speed. Math works out now. 150Mbps upload = 300Tb req."
2016-12-06 19:20:03,"I will try the first. The second - no, but I regularly delete items- but I had a few things I really wanted to keep!"
2016-12-06 19:18:40,@Shawhelp big issue on @Sportsnet 360 right now I click on Ok but message comes back pic.twitter.com/KHBV5yEJc8
2016-12-06 19:11:48,just today!!! You had to do a reboot on my system last week! *sobs*
2016-12-06 19:05:06,"yes, but at 150 Megabit per sec upload speed, the data cap would have to be greater than 300 Terabits. Could you confirm?"
2016-12-06 19:03:38,Um. @Shawhelp ... All my saved shows on my pvr are gone!
2016-12-06 18:54:33,@shawhelp looking for a plan with data cap > 10 Terabit per Megabit of upload speed. Min 15Mbps upload. Or preferably no data cap at all.
2016-12-06 18:53:10,@Shawhelp Internet down in Edmonton? First wifi was going slow... then restarted modem and now no connection
2016-12-06 18:18:05,Done! Thanks. Lots of Canadian Racers who NEED this channel

2016-12-06 17:55:57,it's a HP but he has Windows 10
2016-12-06 17:47:09,We did reboot and it fixed it temporarily yesterday. Back to airplane mode today. Definitely strange!
2016-12-06 17:45:44,"you're a good man Ken, I can tell already the customer service will be much better than @SaskTel #stillonhold"
2016-12-06 17:36:24,Good enough. Thanks!
2016-12-06 17:34:35,@Shawhelp my bf's laptop keeps going on airplane mode. Is the problem with our modem or the laptop itself?
2016-12-06 17:32:07,the 2.4g and the 5g dropped I think it goes to a wall jack
2016-12-06 17:26:29,ok well I did see a few of them drop but not all four.

2016-12-06 16:47:53,"If Digital Receiver is reset, will the box retain all of my saved recorded programs?"
2016-12-06 16:33:58,WHY would the signal ONLY scramble like that during the show and NOT during the commercials? Seems like crappy service @your end.
2016-12-06 16:32:27,Splitter? One cable that goes into the internet thingy & one into the cable box. Is that what you mean?
2016-12-06 15:45:19,@Shawhelp connection is continually dropping. Any suggestions? Happens on multiple devices all at the same time.
2016-12-06 15:43:34,even though that other tv already has a portal it still needs to be set up ?

2016-12-06 12:47:30,did you see @iKasperr 's tweets? Apparently his fiber cable was bent too much.

2016-12-04 20:11:48,@Shawhelp what's the point of paying for HBO if you get shows 2 hours after eastern time zone? This individual channel feature sucks :(

2016-12-04 18:33:55,"I have. I've checked the coax, and tried plugging an dunplugging the power. It seems to get better, then starts to cut out again."
2016-12-04 18:22:24,@Shawhelp is there any service disruption in SW Calgary? My gateway (replaced a month ago) is losing signal on all channels. Help!

2016-12-04 16:55:29,Will she have to dona whole password etc set up again?
2016-12-04 16:54:58,It's newer router/modem combo apparently.
2016-12-04 16:54:06,No she asked me to check Twitter because she knows that were I usually find out about outages lol
2016-12-04 16:52:49,we couldn't agreed more!
2016-12-04 16:48:44,Still says no internet secured.

2016-12-04 16:35:02,@Shawhelp Mom's having issue with internet in Vic. She unplugged both cables. Still having issues.
2016-12-04 16:32:53,"been down that road. short of al la carte or swapping TSN1 for SN360, nothing works."
2016-12-04 16:22:43,oh okay
2016-12-04 16:22:05,231
2016-12-04 16:21:21,what channel is SN 360 again? I don't even remember
2016-12-04 16:20:51,oh okay makes sense. But yeah you can catch rest of game on channel 27 after the Jets game
2016-12-04 16:19:47,"with their ""popular pack, I get every other SN channel but 360. I don't want TSN, but they won't switch"
2016-12-04 16:19:34,oh well they are also playing it on channel 27 after the Wpg game. You will probably just missy the first
2016-12-04 16:18:46,@Shawhelp puts in a different them pack. $10 one channel makes zero sense.
2016-12-04 15:28:55,"no, didn't remove coax. Not there now. Will get back to you."
2016-12-04 15:19:43,"We have departed, will monitor and try next time. Thanks"

2016-12-04 14:11:10,They probably don't want to. Most people are there to cancel their services.
2016-12-04 13:43:23,I'm with @Shawhelp in Saskatoon and Sportsnet has had most games. I have barely needed my CenterIce this year
2016-12-04 13:39:38,all they ever did was increase my rates without increasing the service! @UniserveHelp & @VancouverISP both look better!

2016-12-01 22:23:11,"yes, I have tried that. Only have 1 TV. That;s the only channel affected (that I can tell, so far.)"
2016-12-01 22:22:50,"@Shawhelp Hello my pvr box froze on this screen while trying to delete 1 show. Won't budge or PWR off, hesitant to just unplug... pic.twitter.com/XaVGhKbhSy"
2016-12-01 22:20:16,did not help. Finally got through on chat and internet tanked. Restarting machine and trying again
2016-12-01 22:20:10,there is a cordless phone 2.4 ghz right beside it. The microwave is about 12' away. It's inconsistent tho as sometimes it works
2016-12-01 22:19:18,working now. Any idea what would cause this to happen?
2016-12-01 22:15:09,. @Shawhelp I signed up for WideOpen a month ago.. got billed the day after I got it and just got another bill?? Where's my free month??
2016-12-01 22:13:29,"@shawhelp what happened to CBC News world (ch 26 in lower mainland)? ""No content on this channel"" since yesterday Nov 30."
2016-12-01 22:08:07,thanks for responding and looking into it. @Sportsnet never has and one is to assume doesn't give a $=!t. Unless it's a leaf game
2016-12-01 22:05:35,and I have been waiting for 30 minutes for chat help
2016-12-01 22:03:56,"@Shawhelp suddenly lost all tv. Recoding froze, now we can't get any tv. No picture on any channel. Tried unplugging to reset."
2016-12-01 21:58:24,"tried both channels no change. The direct connection does work better. We were told there was a modem upgrade, can that be setup?"
2016-12-01 21:53:13,"wired, all new equipment that was working earlier"
2016-12-01 21:51:22,yes and only 360
2016-12-01 21:49:38,@Shawhelp is there issues in Abbotsford tonight? My 150 is tanking. pic.twitter.com/cagmdNGz7c
2016-12-01 21:46:10,"@Shawhelp holly fuck 2 hours wait,"
2016-12-01 21:45:59,i did thank you !!
2016-12-01 21:38:57,@Sportsnet this happens all the time and only on this channel pic.twitter.com/KhAUmXHLkH
2016-12-01 21:32:31,will try to get video
2016-12-01 21:31:29,no error msgs. However often issue with just this channel
2016-12-01 21:29:00,understandable. But what's point of call back service if I'm just going to wait an additional 25 + mins? Defeats purpose.
2016-12-01 21:21:02,Very happy with my wifi speeds w my new @ShawInfo @Shawhelp 150/15 Mbps plan. Surpasses expectations! A great price as well! #sprucegrove pic.twitter.com/a0y9Mm760e
2016-12-01 21:11:40,you need a raise! Walk across the street if you're in Vancouver the Christmas market is lit just like broadband 150
2016-12-01 21:09:55,I have a tech on the phone now.
2016-12-01 21:08:59,unfortunately I do not have anything directly connected to the modem. Can a test be run on the modem?
2016-12-01 21:07:39,@Shawhelp been on hold as 'next in queue for 24 minutes! Including call back time been waiting for almost 50 minutes!!!
2016-12-01 21:05:17,I'm just kidding
2016-12-01 21:04:54,This box has no pin hole reset.
2016-12-01 21:03:18,seems to be back up and running for the time being. Not holding my breath though.
2016-12-01 20:59:24,shows pixelated Arris splash screen. Once a minute box tries to restart. All lights flash then go out.
2016-12-01 20:59:18,@Shawhelp @Sportsnet why on earth are you guys showing an NFL game on sportsnet #vancouver instead of @Canucks vs. @AnaheimDucks ? wacky.
2016-12-01 20:57:40,@Shawhelp Brian from Nanaimo branch just took like half an hour over the phone w/me fixing my internet. awesome+well spoke+super helpful.
2016-12-01 20:54:37,Seems to be back up!
2016-12-01 20:53:15,The email to myself isn't delayed now but was earlier. I'm still missing one sent 2 hrs ago.
2016-12-01 20:48:57,any update at all?
2016-12-01 20:47:23,"@Shawhelp Hi, I have a 7 month old Arris Gateway box that keeps trying to start after a reset with no luck."
2016-12-01 20:46:09,I've done that with a Gmail account. It was delayed. The one that never showed up was shaw to shaw. Sending from my email works
2016-12-01 20:41:02,if they can't figure out the lower mainland you people in okotoks r screwed
2016-12-01 20:40:24,Both. I know one email I should have received 2 hrs ago hasn't shown up. Others taking 30+ minutes.

2016-12-01 20:38:03,"@shawhelp also, customer service phone number isn't working."
2016-12-01 20:37:17,@shawhelp internet communications within Okotoks (I.e. North Okotoks to South Okotoks) work ok. Everything else touch and go.
2016-12-01 20:36:15,I'm trying to activate my tv box and I have a huge mess. Called three times now.
2016-12-01 20:34:29,it was playing the Canucks and Ducks game.
2016-12-01 20:32:58,@Shawhelp are there problems with email? I can send fine but receiving is taking a long time. Some emails haven't come through at all.
2016-12-01 20:30:34,"When you want to watch the @EdmontonOilers game, but restriction applies and can't find it on TV @Shawhelp"

2016-12-01 19:29:05,it's internet speed. Here's some recent tests. I work from home it's unacceptable pic.twitter.com/AtGRPL5dAy

2016-12-01 19:18:15,Seriously @Shawhelp . It's been 1 hour PAST est. hold time. Four calls with waits in the past 4 months. Your hold music driving me crazy now.
2016-12-01 19:11:41,@ShawInfo @Shawhelp Instead of burning logs how about Fox Sports Racing that we are technically still paying for! pic.twitter.com/6wJI53yu3k
2016-12-01 19:10:56,"@Shawhelp Wait time was ""estimated 16 minutes"". I've been on hold an hour. Do some of your calls just get caught in a loop, not answered?"
2016-12-01 18:59:58,"no, TV and HDTV is working. Unplugged and replugged modem, didn't seem to fix anything."
2016-12-01 18:55:01,if can get me out of my contract I'm all yours

2016-12-01 18:33:22,ya I know. Same as last week. And the week before.
2016-12-01 18:29:48,Why? That's a disappointment for someone who doesn't have access to a cable box.

2016-12-01 18:07:01,it occurs pretty much everytime I try to watch sports. Doesn't matter if I'm WiFi my cell service or Shaw on the go WiFi
2016-12-01 18:06:33,Hey @Shawhelp I've been waitin at home for 3.5hrs for the tech for my scheduled 3-5 appt to show up. When is he coming? This is ridiculous
2016-12-01 18:05:32,Is all of Shaw's channels available through pick and play? I was not able to add TSN or SportsNet individually to a package
2016-12-01 18:03:19,yes. That is the one.
2016-12-01 18:03:14,@Shawhelp what does this mean? I'm trying to watch hockey but you know this showed up! I see content tho pic.twitter.com/WHAsCxlfem
2016-12-01 17:55:36,"@Shawhelp I was 10 minutes into watching the latest Days of Our Lives episode, and the ""Thanks for watching"" bit came up. Not done yet!"

2016-12-01 17:48:13,Found it. Thank you!
2016-12-01 17:48:12,In ALBERTA I think it is on Sportsnet One
2016-12-01 17:46:04,@Shawhelp isn't Shaw suppose to be have their channels ala carte starting December 1st? Shaw doesn't have all channels available for this.
2016-12-01 17:41:58,What station is broadcasting the Jets/Oilers game? Can't find it in Calgary. @Shawhelp can't see it on your Center Ice package. @TSNHockey ?
2016-12-01 17:15:41,is there any sort of workaround as I can't even make it through a netflix episode like this :(
2016-12-01 17:15:12,"its not just a notice, currently can't hold onto my connection for longer than 30ish mins at a go and apple has confirmed problem"
2016-12-01 17:11:07,@Shawhelp I have been on hold for 1 hour and 16 minutes. WHY
2016-12-01 17:09:27,"hi :) Im having the same issue, I have a mac, I'm surrounded by networks using proper country code how did you fix it?"
2016-12-01 16:56:22,a busy signal on the customer help line? That can't be a good sign
2016-12-01 16:53:19,@Shawhelp any outages reported in Moose Jaw area?
2016-12-01 16:51:50,@Shawhelp is there an outage in prince albert

2016-12-01 15:27:45,@Shawhelp channels 6 8 and 9 are terrible pixation in this neighborhood
2016-12-01 15:16:18,are you unable to separate them or did you choose not to?
2016-12-01 15:12:29,@Shawhelp I was told when I switched to shaw from telus that Shaw would pay up to $150 for switchover fees. How do you take care of that?
2016-12-01 15:08:19,I meant a-la carte. This is a channel you already carry.
2016-12-01 15:04:36,I was hoping that the Firelog Twitter would be back this year. Highlight of the Xmas season.
2016-12-01 14:59:16,When @Shawhelp phone wait time says 10 mins or less and you've been waiting for 52 mins...
2016-12-01 14:51:19,"Again, it is very strange that you don't offer KSTW in addition to all of those. Please consider changing this."
2016-12-01 14:12:22,"alright, thanks for the help"
2016-12-01 14:08:01,"yes. Quite the wierd, strange coincidence. My internet gets slow right at the time you start promoting your other product..."
2016-12-01 14:00:54,"@Shawhelp My internet has been down for over 24 hours and I'm unable to reach support via phone, can you help me out?"
2016-12-01 13:54:53,"Upgradings not my call, just trying to guarantee I get what's paid for though"
2016-12-01 13:53:42,I've unplugged and reset the router already
2016-12-01 13:53:05,well I'm having internet issues it says it's connected and allows you to sign on to the network but it's not really connected
2016-12-01 13:50:53,Oooh thanks!
2016-12-01 13:49:27,"@Shawhelp I've been on hold for an hour with tech support, what gives??"
2016-12-01 13:46:51,"@Shawhelp any known issues in prince albert? Net went out 20 minutes ago, tried power cycling to no avail"

2016-12-01 13:40:00,"30, but that should give higher down and up. Im pinging at best at 24 down 2.5 up, at worst 20 down 2 up. Should be 30down 5up"
2016-12-01 13:39:36,I think Netflix has a holiday log channel...
2016-12-01 13:37:20,plugged in and Wi-Fi stopped working for about 20 minutes. Back up now!
2016-12-01 13:36:29,"I have spoken to no one, I gave up. If you could pass it on I will leave it with you"
2016-12-01 13:33:48,"To be fair, it CAN contain ANY of the channels cable companies want. Shaw chose the lineup; CRTC only mandated the price."
2016-12-01 13:27:31,and you can't say that's common practice cause no other company I have bills with does this sound why is shaw so special
2016-12-01 13:23:52,", not fair at all plus add in equipment rentals! #consumersgettingsoaked !"
2016-12-01 13:22:43,that can be said about a lot of the programming
2016-12-01 13:19:34,"Okay. I honestly thought Frame was a free channel —considering it has, you know, no actual content. Thanks for the help though. :)"
2016-12-01 13:17:13,"via ethernet, and i've tried that, tried resetting the modem and router, resetting computers ethernet adapter as well"
2016-12-01 13:15:52,message sent
2016-12-01 13:15:02,well I only get paid once month and can't ask for any advanced pay so how does it make sense you can on billing

2016-12-01 12:43:13,I believe Jan 1-30. But that shouldn't matter because I've already made four seperate payments before this.
2016-12-01 12:35:55,@Shawhelp The estimated 16 minute wait time is now up to 40 minutes. You guys are tech gurus! Can't even get your phone wait times right
2016-12-01 12:32:48,No idea. Can you look it up for me? But FRAME is in a sold package for God's sake?! FRAME?!
2016-12-01 12:18:29,it was out from 11 pm to at least 3 am. It's back now
2016-12-01 12:17:50,"would you be able to take a look at my bill then or would I have to call? Ive made payments of 47,49,49,49 and just got charged 49"

2016-12-01 12:05:34,Go home @Shawhelp you're drunk #winnipeg pic.twitter.com/XJtRXRMV6I
2016-12-01 12:04:54,"If that's the case, why isn't it available a-la carte? This seems like an oversight that should be addressed."
2016-12-01 12:04:38,@Shawhelp should there be?
2016-12-01 12:04:32,@Shawhelp quick question. If you got nfl Sunday ticket during the early bird with the monthly payment options how many monthly payments
2016-12-01 11:56:11,@Shawhelp The holiday log channel (222) costs money this year?!
2016-12-01 11:54:01,when you phone CRA 8281#it says the number has changed and offers to redirect for a fee. CRA has no idea that this is happening
2016-12-01 11:47:09,"just sitting on hold waiting to let you know there is something hinky going on with the CRA phone number, they said to call you..."
2016-12-01 11:27:46,"Is it included with Limited TV, though? I don't see it listed."
2016-12-01 11:26:30,@Shawhelp every time I call you're experiencing higher than usual call volume doesn't that just mean you're experiencing normal call volume?
2016-12-01 11:19:58,@Shawhelp https:// twitter.com/crtceng/status /804389237239988224 …
2016-12-01 11:11:15,@Shawhelp I thought today you could pick just 1 channel at a time not a package of channels @CRTCeng this isn't right
2016-12-01 11:09:31,ok
2016-12-01 11:04:48,"I found WPIX on the website, but not KSTW. Is it possible to get KSTW a-la carte?"
2016-12-01 10:53:22,Thought this happened months ago - what's new today?
2016-12-01 10:52:15,the cookingchannel.ca says to find the channel on Shaw Refer to BDU site. What?
2016-12-01 10:46:20,I'm more inclined than ever to #CutTheCord . #GreedyBastards . #WorstPractices . @Shawhelp
2016-12-01 10:26:05,Reporting tonight on the skinny TV add-on channels. Are the per channel prices fair? #crtc @rogers @Bell @Shawhelp @cogeco pic.twitter.com/GH63cbbeSL
2016-12-01 10:26:04,no - they did the exact same thing last time this happened & sub'd in Raymond
2016-12-01 10:07:03,Detroit Public Television. I can't seem to find an a la carte option for either one on your website.
2016-12-01 10:03:48,@Shawhelp internet has been down since last night. In abbotsford. Is this a known issue or likely account issue?
2016-12-01 09:56:31,Observation about @Shawhelp 's offerings: you can't get The CW or DPTV a la carte? I'm pretty sure they're supposed to qualify.
2016-12-01 09:46:34,"Black screen says signal loss detected. Have reset 3 times, same result"
2016-12-01 09:42:24,this happened last time too - so someone must have also noticed audio distortion on GG
2016-12-01 09:41:40,just started happening last week. Now program has been changed mid-stream to Everybody Loves Raymond & audio is fine.
2016-12-01 09:36:26,"@Shawhelp our gateway tv has been out since 5:30 am in Woodbine, Calgary. Is it out in the area or what is going on? Internet works fine"
2016-12-01 09:34:00,nope. Other channels fine & commercials on Deja are fine. Just the program audio is loud hiss.
2016-12-01 09:22:54,"@Shawhelp Hi there. I was just looking at the cost for only HBO and it does not seem to be offered a la carte, only as a package. Any deets?"
2016-12-01 09:12:44,@Shawhelp what's with the hissing audio distortion on Deja View (again) ?
2016-12-01 09:05:36,tried multiple times offline for 4 hrs told by your colleagues there was an outage
2016-12-01 09:05:07,"why is the internet still down? The document I was sent said it would be out from 12-6, it has been out since 10pm, it's now 8am!"

2016-11-30 22:55:08,I think so. But it's 2 hours early from what is posted. Is there a way to get emails regarding scheduled maintenance?
2016-11-30 22:49:39,"@Shawhelp is the Prince George, BC area down for maintenance? Or are there other issues?"
2016-11-30 22:32:54,"@Shawhelp last ever day of Shomi, so settle down to watch Pinky Blinders and Shomi is broken #FAIL"

2016-11-30 13:51:23,having our tv service and internet go out weekly/bi weekly at midnight is not acceptable it's not even helping the random outages

2016-11-29 18:33:47,"@Shawhelp I'm pretty sure that WWE Smackdown Live is on SN360 right now, not NHL's best. Way to screw things up as usual."
2016-11-29 18:31:01,@ShawInfo @Shawhelp gotta love paying for internet 150 and then getting this. pic.twitter.com/kgzRyp10gs

2016-11-29 18:06:07,@Sportsnet @Shawhelp How come the guide is showing WWE Smackdown is only on for 30 minutes on Sportsnet360? And then NHL Best is on? #SDLive
2016-11-29 17:59:45,"the upstream and downstream lights are now solid blue, but still no internet."
2016-11-29 17:58:54,thanks
2016-11-29 17:57:56,thanks. Modem works with Ethernet cable but NOT wifi. Tried another reset (I'll stop doing that). Any wifi generating ideas
2016-11-29 17:57:51,@Shawhelp Internet is completely down at 116 Rockywood Park NW...an unplanned outage??
2016-11-29 17:51:11,"Seriously? Okay, my mistake. Didn't look too close, and yet very convincing."
2016-11-29 17:50:34,I left my @Shawhelp internet for @TELUSsupport . I've made a terrible mistake. Internet connection is so slow that it makes me wanna puke
2016-11-29 17:47:08,"@Shawhelp not sure you can answer this, but where is the Bruins Flyers game?"
2016-11-29 17:45:09,@Shawhelp What channel is the Flyers-Bruins game? Can't find it on my Centre Ice. In Winnipeg btw.
2016-11-29 17:40:42,"So fscking intrusive, @Shawhelp . Seriously, don't fsck with people's Internet please. pic.twitter.com/KJUgMPny39"

2016-11-29 17:36:17,"Both. The green light is blinking indicating it's searching for a downstream, if that's helpful."
2016-11-29 17:34:19,intermittently on and off
2016-11-29 17:32:32,wired directly
2016-11-29 17:24:06,internet is beyond broken
2016-11-29 17:24:02,"@Shawhelp My Hitron modem has suddenly refused to connect to the internet. I've tried every reset, checked every connection, still nothing."
2016-11-29 16:58:16,"just played a game was not kicked. But it will happen again soon, did it 6 times last night."
2016-11-29 16:53:52,I'm not a noob. It's not that I'm on LAN and I'm fully aware of modem reset. It's not on my end period.
2016-11-29 16:53:36,Hey @Shawhelp - can you let the tech know I will be home about 10min late? I'm scheduled from 6 to 8. DM me for details.
2016-11-29 16:48:07,both.
2016-11-29 16:47:59,I do multiple tests at a time when it's good I get around 100m down and around 8m up.
2016-11-29 16:46:16,regardless the connection should never be bad enough for me to be kick from games and chat. No I do not own a PC
2016-11-29 16:41:26,@Shawhelp looking for some help to bridge the new modem for the new 150 plan
2016-11-29 16:36:08,@Shawhelp this is supposed to be your new 150mbs. Cuts out or fluctuates all the time in my area. Been happening more and more lately pic.twitter.com/1fH4JKtp3w
2016-11-29 16:30:59,internet connection down near Nelson BC? Modem reset etc no help
2016-11-29 16:30:21,no dice. Reset both devices and just get channel names. Lights all blink on the main box.
2016-11-29 15:09:12,Last night on #PBS KCTS9 Seattle. AndreRieu Johann Strauss Concert from Holland (10pm mid-Island). Interruptions+ sound hiccups
2016-11-29 15:09:05,@Shawhelp Any outages reported in New West? My Internet isn't working and the TVs are saying 'Signal loss detected'
2016-11-29 14:29:41,maxing 10mb on my 30 or 50mb plan on all devices. will try ethernet
2016-11-29 14:26:13,"@Shawhelp Any advice on making the Arris gateway work consistently? No descriptions, no app connection, no recording, lights flashing."
2016-11-29 13:54:58,Thanks for the update. I'm having to use my 4G hotspot for WIFI. Any charges will be billed directly to Shaw due to this outage.
2016-11-29 13:45:03,not sure how seeing as I'm within 10ft of my router
2016-11-29 13:39:16,@Shawhelp This is my monthly plea for you to add native IPv6 to your network and especially shaw go WiFi. VPNs are annoying!
2016-11-29 13:37:16,why am I paying for 150 when it's not 150?
2016-11-29 13:36:29,it's all over the map
2016-11-29 13:36:23,on 150 Speedtest was giving me 79 Mbps on 5G and then mins later it was 48mbps then jumped up to 130mbps
2016-11-29 13:21:07,I finally got through to someone after half an hour. There is an issue in the Port Moody area. #Shaw
2016-11-29 13:20:24,it's like that everywhere in #yyj I'm over by Gorge and it's garbage. I have the new fast 150 and it's SLOW!
2016-11-29 13:20:19,@Shawhelp so? What's up?! No Internet OR cable! ET it will be up and working again? pic.twitter.com/F2f4T3ozxx
2016-11-29 13:17:47,where can we go to get a replacement for our PVR remote. It is not working properly - we've replaced the batteries several times.
2016-11-29 13:08:12,Shaw - your lack of Internet connection in #Esquimalt #VicWest #yyj is killing me. Any idea when it will be back up? @Shawhelp
2016-11-29 12:55:11,@Shawhelp Is there issues currently with broadband? Can't connect and have rebooted router and normal process etc.
2016-11-29 12:37:50,are there any issues in the west coquitlam area. my 30mb connection is running extremely slow. tried factory default on router.
2016-11-29 12:13:15,"@Shawhelp Internet keeps going down and up, what's going on?"
2016-11-29 11:23:38,@Shawhelp do you know which TV channel The Frame moved to while @ShawFireLog is on 165 & 225?
2016-11-29 10:52:16,"@Shawhelp internet down at UBC, any word of when it'll be back up?"
2016-11-29 10:46:07,"thanks DH, I'll try this"
2016-11-29 10:31:35,"@shawhelp Internet is down in Strathcona Park, Calgary. Any idea when it will be back up? Thanks"
2016-11-29 10:29:42,which stops any media being streamed because connecting requires a shaw account. it ruins the mobile streaming experience
2016-11-29 10:29:11,what i'm saying is the existence of shaw open wifi all over cities means phones connect to it even if you're not a shaw customer
2016-11-29 10:21:09,Hey @Shawhelp - any plans to do something similar? https:// twitter.com/OntPhotog/stat us/803612151923490816 …
2016-11-29 10:06:35,"No official word yet, but let @Shawhelp know that you're interested!"
2016-11-29 08:37:36,"@Shawhelp Are there issues with internet at main and 2nd, Vancouver ? i have 150 meg seeing only 15 meg on all speed tests on all browsers."

2016-11-28 21:29:02,"Dear @Shawhelp , all I want for Christmas is internet that actually works"
2016-11-28 21:27:30,The only adage I can give tonight is that @shawhelp is the reason everyone I know is getting an android box and canceling thier service.
2016-11-28 21:26:54,same thing as far as kits. Tried the reboot - nada

2016-11-28 10:15:33,@Shawhelp hi. Is there a reason my house wifi password doesnt work for my work laptop? I'm typing the pswd correctly.
2016-11-28 10:10:42,still glad we switched but it's not awesome when we have 150 and no streaming!
2016-11-28 10:10:09,"using your wifi, and an apple time capsule as a booster. Never had problems when we were with Telus."

2016-11-26 15:19:45,"Done, thanks!"
2016-11-26 15:10:56,No 3rd-party routers. Tried other port. Very stable 92+/-1 Mbps.
2016-11-26 15:10:53,It's ok. I may get them to phone in. I don't think they are on Twitter.
2016-11-26 15:10:44,"we had channels as of about 15 min ago, then just lost them."
2016-11-26 15:10:18,"Did that, still only get 221. All other channels say to contact Shaw."
2016-11-26 15:02:57,Sure.
2016-11-26 15:01:40,I thought it was more a general thing. Was asking for a friend who needs a new router. I have Internet 150 myself.
2016-11-26 14:58:32,I have no channels available except BNNHD on 221.
2016-11-26 14:55:05,"@Shawhelp ""Signal loss detected, check your cable connection or call shaw"" help!"

2016-11-26 14:44:18,"Right. I was a Cat 5 cable. However, after trying a 5e cable it remains exactly the same, 92. Odd, over wi-fi I have measured 150."

2016-11-26 14:39:04,truly thank u for ur help
2016-11-26 14:28:37,thank u but figured it out - seems I blocked channels I never had & when I updated my pkg I should've updated channel list thnx
2016-11-26 14:26:43,@Shawhelp Noticing that with I-150 and a box wired directly into router/modem that I don't get over 92 Mbps. Local issue?
2016-11-26 14:26:03,@Shawhelp upgraded to 150 & modem won't connect.Told it was escalated to engg team & would get a follow up at 1 PST. No call. Time 4 Telus?
2016-11-26 14:09:06,thanks - I'll call the help line because that channel is not displayed here - find odd because I do subscribe to a sports pkg thnx
2016-11-26 13:52:15,@Shawhelp why have u not been airing the @F1 races - only qualifying? Tomorrow is last race of year. Where can I find it?

2016-11-25 22:46:00,"Everything came back as I was chatting with Shaw support, I'm using the modem in bridge mode. Thanks for responding!"

2016-11-25 18:15:04,How long is the deal on for?
2016-11-25 17:13:40,I just stumbled onto the cause. It appears to be an ios device problem. Sorry for bothering you.
2016-11-25 16:45:07,"Can't, sorry. Account isn't in my name, he's not available right now. I know that's not helpful. Anything else I can try doing?"
2016-11-25 16:31:08,"@Shawhelp Everyday this week, for several hour periods I'm getting ping spikes, download speeds unbelievably slow. Resetting does nothing."
2016-11-25 16:18:42,"Logged into my own account, it shouldn't say $49 AFTER submitting upgrade. Got an email after submitting showing the fine print."
2016-11-25 16:13:05,"Tried that, Shaw confirmed faulty main box. Really terrible service to have to wait a week, especiallyfor a more expensive system"
2016-11-25 15:34:36,"Yes, I'm considering that one. But might want to add cable too, trying to see what's more worth it since I don't have a tv yet."
2016-11-25 15:12:55,"& possibly a pet, so I'm sad that you were joking about the puppy"
2016-11-25 15:09:21,"no, just moved so I need to setup home internet now & possibly cable."
2016-11-25 15:04:52,it appears we are back in business

2016-11-25 14:59:02,"Sorry, dont need any troubleshooting, just a remote reset please :)"
2016-11-25 14:52:50,and never mind service came back

2016-11-25 14:33:24,What do you have that's comparable to the telus deal with the $500 prepaid visa?
2016-11-25 14:18:02,"@shawhelp how long does it take for an internet upgrade to kick in? I went from 30 to 150, but still getting the same speeds w/ new modem."
2016-11-25 14:00:50,No improvement elsewhere in the house
2016-11-25 14:00:37,"I left is almost 5 minutes unplugged. No significant change in speeds. 94.4 direct connect, better wireless from 2 feet away at 95"
2016-11-25 13:50:16,ok. It is unplugged. I'll advise in a few minutes
2016-11-25 13:48:12,"@Shawhelp Had the Gateway System installed 2 days ago it stopped working due to a faulty box. Shaw says this is rare,but wont fix for a week"
2016-11-25 13:46:09,"It's not a great time, but I may be able to get it done...."
2016-11-25 13:36:05,I had unplugged but not for that long
2016-11-25 13:35:29,no new devices... haven't tried the unplug yet.... will do that later.... can't do that right now

2016-11-25 12:20:06,just make sure nobody's going to miss their mail. I assume you can see in your system what letters have been sent to that address

2016-11-22 14:36:39,I don't know
2016-11-22 14:18:18,@Shawhelp 36 hours and still no internet.
2016-11-22 14:17:43,thanks. Last update was 3.5 hours ago. Anything more current?
2016-11-22 14:15:23,"Cable box on all tv's, came back after 15 minutes...."
2016-11-22 14:14:37,it was happening to me also earlier but seems to have fixed itself
2016-11-22 14:13:58,"@Bell I like how even though you don't have mobile service, you responded before the company I'm complaining about. #ProvedMeRight"
2016-11-22 14:13:48,@Shawhelp #winnipeg internet has been offline since 10 am around Logan and Salter. Any update?
2016-11-22 14:08:01,"seems to have fixed itself now but it was strictly the tsn channels. Weird. We'll just chalk it up to aliens, I guess."
2016-11-22 14:07:22,it's been cutting in and out pretty regularly over the last couple of hours (on the South side)
2016-11-22 14:05:14,@Shawhelp Any TV cable transmission problems in YYJ area? Some channels not working or freezing but many others Okay.
2016-11-22 14:04:53,@Shawhelp do you guys do mobile phones? @Bell is about to lose me. You seem to be the only T/C company with ANY customer service. #TopDogs
2016-11-22 14:03:20,@ShawInfo @Shawhelp thanks for the super easy address move! Your technician Dan was friendly and helpful and made sure everything was good!
2016-11-22 14:02:41,"@Shawhelp what is going on with your channels like ""o"" and ""w"" they are blacking out and all weirdly pixalated"
2016-11-22 14:00:57,@Shawhelp cable cutting in and out trying to watch any of my tsn channels. Any idea why?
2016-11-22 14:00:08,@Shawhelp have there been any reports of issues with Stingray music this afternoon in Edmonton?
2016-11-22 13:55:45,I noticed it just as I was leaving for work. I will not be back home until later tonight.
2016-11-22 13:55:34,"it's acting fine all of a sudden, and I need to get some work done. But I'll try that next time."
2016-11-22 13:54:56,"@Shawhelp trying to watch tv but the connection is terrible. So much pixelating & freezing, did someone steal the robot hamster? #yyc"
2016-11-22 13:54:33,Check out my @Speedtest result! How fast is your internet? @Shawhelp http://www. speedtest.net/my-result/i/18 67000230 …
2016-11-22 13:54:24,thanks but it is 5G wifi already. I've gotten 160+ on 5G wifi when I first signed up (it's been a month or so since I last tested)
2016-11-22 13:53:15,Never mind it came back on!
2016-11-22 13:51:32,@Shawhelp Gotta love it when the TV bandwidth takes a crap 3/4 through a good movie. Happens too often here.
2016-11-22 13:50:43,In the Saskatoon area.
2016-11-22 13:50:33,@Shawhelp Do you know why my cable is out? I have working internet but my channels went out. I have no stations.
2016-11-22 13:49:24,happening on both boxes. Ch29 (HGTV) & Ch 48 (DTOUR).
2016-11-22 13:45:53,"Never called in. I've spoke to you, months ago & nothing was said or done. Nowadays, I just curse, but that doesn't help, either."
2016-11-22 13:40:27,"into a splitter, splitter is connected to the pvr."
2016-11-22 13:39:56,@Shawhelp I guess they took jobs from Alberta but kept them in Canada at least unlike my friends at @TELUS
2016-11-22 13:38:37,@Shawhelp I previously offered 100 channels I don't watch for the east coast @w_network . Upping that offer to 200. #BacheloretteCA
2016-11-22 13:34:12,@Shawhelp What's going on with Broadband 150? The download speeds today are awful http://www. speedtest.net/my-result/5819 598322 …

2016-11-22 12:55:39,seemed to show up. Was the Dave chapelle episode but only monologue and skits. I think it was from global?

2016-11-19 02:52:20,3/3- internet the past 5 months Will the amount of gigabytes they've used increase my grandma's monthly bill if they use too much?
2016-11-19 02:51:10,"2/3- Soon as she told me that, I went outside telling them to leave, they said their friend gave them permission to use grandma's"
2016-11-19 02:50:10,1/3- Someone gave out my grandma's wifi password & she told me she's noticed groups of people sitting in her yard with laptops
2016-11-19 02:43:38,@Shawhelp There's something I am curious about...

2016-11-18 16:44:28,twitter isn't allowing me to send you a DM for some reason. I've already enabled it so i can recieve DM's from anyone.
2016-11-18 16:43:45,@Shawhelp could use some help with our gateway. No portals are working at all

2016-11-18 16:31:59,@Shawhelp when do the digital music Christmas stations start and what channel will they be?
2016-11-18 16:30:00,@Shawhelp are you guys by chance having issues with your DNS server again?
2016-11-18 16:22:26,@Shawhelp cable box may be broken. Squeals when plugged in and nothing comes up on the front screen. Motorola DCX3510-M
2016-11-18 16:20:35,directly wired. He tried to upgrade it from his end as the tech is scheduled to come in in a week or so. Could that be an issue?
2016-11-18 15:57:14,"ok, thanks for being on top of it. Is there a RFO yet?"
2016-11-18 15:49:49,The fact he blocked me straight away I'm pretty sure this guy broke quite a few protocols.
2016-11-18 15:47:16,i was at about 50-80 yesterday. Now i'm at roughly 5000. I've already restarded my modem several times.
2016-11-18 15:45:04,@Shawhelp hello. Is there an internet outage in Parksville?
2016-11-18 15:44:46,@Shawhelp charged $135 for the wide open plan. P.s. I am on a two year contract
2016-11-18 15:40:13,He blocked me on Facebook as soon as I called him out on it.
2016-11-18 15:30:57,"@Shawhelp I just upgraded to internet 150 from internet 80 last night, now as i just got home from work today my ping is through the roof?"

2016-11-18 15:16:34,I just got back and for some reason I can't dm you.
2016-11-18 14:26:14,cathy give more details ... channel and location shaw help tends to be from bc
2016-11-18 13:58:52,"Okay, keep me updated. Just FYI for 3 PM CT: FOX 28 will go to paid programming of some sort, FOX Rochester should air Judge Judy."
2016-11-18 13:43:58,nope. Pender and Howe.
2016-11-18 13:42:32,"...it's on Crime Watch Daily which FOX 28 is playing. Channel numbers are for Winnipeg West, unsure if other areas affected."
2016-11-18 13:41:41,"This includes commercials for Spokane playing on WUHF too. Right now WUHF/FOX Rochester should be on Hot Bench, but instead..."
2016-11-18 13:40:57,@Shawhelp It seems that FOX 28's feed in Spokane (ch. 82/203) is playing on the feed for FOX Rochester (ch. 49/208).
2016-11-18 13:18:12,yup
2016-11-18 12:57:16,"Will do. Thanks for the assistance, SJ."
2016-11-18 12:57:02,@Shawhelp really need to evaluate your corporate account interactions. Would appreciate a DM and to speak with a supervisor.

2016-11-18 12:27:41,@Shawhelp Is there issues with Shaw in Spruce Grove? My cable and internet have been out since this morning.
2016-11-18 12:19:03,"@Shawhelp I haven't had internet for a day now, is there any problems with the internet ."
2016-11-18 12:09:39,Why is it that whenever I phone for help Shaw treats me like i'm a moron. They asked me if I had turned the power button on. smfh @Shawhelp
2016-11-18 12:04:59,$60k and Advertisement agreement with @TELUS or @Rogers or @Shawhelp could likely have put wifi on some local buses
2016-11-18 11:39:10,Arris box - it's the only one we've had so not sure if there's a bigger one. Sorry
2016-11-18 11:20:38,@Shawhelp Hi! We're having trouble with one of our gateway boxes I think. Remote turns it on only.
2016-11-18 11:04:08,Hi. It's working now! We tried a reset again and it fixed it! Thanks for your help.
2016-11-18 11:03:50,@MTSHelps thx for making me wait for 2 hours and top up the parking meter 2 times for nothing!! @Shawhelp when r u guys gonna get phones

2016-11-17 22:30:16,yes I’ve done that before and now yet again? What’s my transportation compensation ?
2016-11-17 22:25:50,@Shawhelp My “3rd” Shaw remote Is toast. Yes I’ve changed batteries. Great finger workout. How do I get yet another replacement?
2016-11-17 22:18:09,Thanks anyways
2016-11-17 22:15:04,Any idea when?
2016-11-17 22:12:55,tried exchange and I map. It was working fine until 2 days ago
2016-11-17 22:12:53,@ShawInfo @Shawhelp Is residential IPv6 available yet?

2016-11-17 20:42:24,Thanks @Shawhelp ! @KandiiVan possible please to whisper/DM the traceroute?
2016-11-17 20:26:11,"@Shawhelp dont know what the login is for the forums, but here is the traceroute Tracing route to (cont) http:// tl.gd/n_1spaain"
2016-11-17 20:10:04,"The business guy helped, thank you."
2016-11-17 20:07:14,"certainly, not at my pc at the moment but will do ASAP"
2016-11-17 19:51:38,Correct. Has been occurring for ~2 weeks. Only happens in certain lobbies (specific servers potentially?).
2016-11-17 19:50:24,"This has been going on for a while for you, right (i.e., not just today/tonight)? @Shawhelp"
2016-11-17 19:48:54,"Im in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. Other affected users are located in Fort St. John and Winnipeg."
2016-11-17 19:46:20,"All I can ask of you, thank you brotha!"
2016-11-17 19:45:30,That's very interesting. Maybe a peering issue? Will share w/ team in the AM.
2016-11-17 19:43:56,"More than likely yes, but it appears that all of us that are with @shawhelp in canada are having the same issue"
2016-11-17 19:39:34,and all of us are experiencing these disconnects.
2016-11-17 19:39:16,"These disconnects are an issue between you two @H1Z1KotK @Shawhelp , myself @FvFury99 @bloodinfernoo @haladanielle are all on shaw."
2016-11-17 19:15:30,well more crappy performance. This time in Richmond Centre food court. Progress spinning and spinning.
2016-11-17 18:51:36,@shawhelp whats up with poor service in south calgary tonight?
2016-11-17 18:43:45,"@Shawhelp Just got a new DVR box & trying 2 reprogram recordings, after 2 shows... Scheduling Series is all I can C. Does it take a while?"
2016-11-17 18:32:13,@Shawhelp can you tell me if the house I'm moving to is capable of Internet 150?
2016-11-17 18:19:36,So this is the second time within 2 weeks that our shaw tv isn't working AGAIN! Like what gives?!!!!! @Shawhelp

2016-11-17 18:08:56,nearest retail store is 3.5 hours. A tech said it affected all customer using Hitron modem due to a firmware problem.
2016-11-17 18:01:54,it only affected people with the Hitron modem.
2016-11-17 18:01:04,"Tired of trying new steps everytime i call or reach out through twitter, If a tech does not come fix it i will switch to telus."
2016-11-17 18:00:44,shaw down in our town and you guys keep saying there's nothing wrong in the area. Lots of shaw user doesn't have internet
2016-11-17 17:58:01,Joy. Won't have @Shawhelp internet till my appointment. No internet for a week. Time to find a Bell hot spot coffee shop
2016-11-17 17:32:10,"@Shawhelp Tired of troubleshooting my internet, i dont know if its intereference or just bad router range."
2016-11-17 16:56:33,@Shawhelp my crave tv won't load on Apple TV. Is it possible too many devices connected to wifi? I have internet 30?
2016-11-17 16:43:57,How long does it usually take to set up phone/tv/internet?
2016-11-17 16:37:20,"Same with TV, as well. I can't seem to find anything that indicates a contract term, the way the value plan lists 2 years."
2016-11-17 16:37:15,But thanks for looking and responding. Tell your higher ups to start investing in the infrastructure for Fibre. Cheers!
2016-11-17 16:36:18,"and at this point that's my opinion, don't need you guys trying to prove anything to me. $100+ for inconsistent speeds is weak."
2016-11-17 16:35:21,pinging servers to find a speed is IN THEORY a snapshot; real test is the consistency; which is what I'm talking about.
2016-11-17 16:34:09,"I already said, speed tests are not the be it all end all; they're basic and do not actually reflect any data going back and forth"
2016-11-17 16:27:06,"@Shawhelp Hi, can you tell me if your phone plans (not bundles) are tied into a contract, or if they go month to month like Internet 30?"
2016-11-17 16:15:22,"Either way, being on copper lines, it's never going to be steady; we all know speed tests are a very basic snapshot. Such is life"
2016-11-17 16:14:18,160?! PC/XB1 are wired. Only wireless is phones. Your wired connections fluctuate too much for $100+ price; not even peak hrs
2016-11-17 16:06:21,we're right in Vancouver
2016-11-17 15:20:25,@Shawhelp internet and tv out. 24 @198 street Langley. Known issue?
2016-11-17 15:20:04,sharing is caring!
2016-11-17 14:59:22,lol....how do I DM my address :)
2016-11-17 14:53:26,check my latest tweet response :)
2016-11-17 14:53:07,the issue was resolved by updating chromium. The issue started in the last few days. Best tell others to update too if they see it
2016-11-17 14:38:02,"well I'm on Linux, but the issue doesn't show up with Firefox or chrome, looks like just chromium. Issue may not be on your end."
2016-11-17 14:20:21,chromium v53. I'm getting this error attached : pic.twitter.com/xEX7aGdLUZ
2016-11-17 14:01:25,@Shawhelp ssl cert issues on the webmail page. Best look into it ASAP.
2016-11-17 12:35:18,No splitters and no kinks as far as I know. Speeds are great but just dropped 3 times in past 20 mins.
2016-11-17 12:29:53,@Shawhelp Since upgrading to shaw 150 I get freq inet drops(10-15 times/day or more). Everything disconnects for 20-30 seconds. Any ideas?

2016-11-14 11:49:55,Another hard reset of the router fixes it again. But that's a few times in the past few days. Definitely something weird there
2016-11-14 11:49:16,"This is multiple Macs wired and wife and mobile devices wifi, on the Shaw router as well as other routers on the network. 1/2"
2016-11-14 11:25:50,@Shawhelp Looks like we have another outage in the South Surrey area. Is that the case?
2016-11-14 11:21:29,in the same boat. ETA much appreciated as I work from Starbucks until it's fixed #newwest
2016-11-14 11:16:56,This is wired connection or wifi. It was on and off slow all weekend and happened last week as well.
2016-11-14 11:15:17,it's down again this morning. Is there an outage again in South Surrey??
2016-11-14 11:14:34,this outage is literally destroying my day... I'd appreciate an ETA as well.

2016-11-14 08:34:59,What is error code 100 on ShawFree? Its annoyingingly frequently occuring
2016-11-14 08:31:06,@Shawhelp I'm in Downtown New Westminster and still unable to connect to internet. At least Twitter now working - what's current ETA?

2016-11-13 20:23:46,You guys have been awesome. How about running some fibre optic to north Springbank for internet? So many would gladly switch.

2016-11-12 17:57:16,@Shawhelp So much was cut out and missed out because of out of province football?!? Not impressed with it being cut

2016-11-12 13:29:39,@Shawhelp it's very disappointing that Shaw is broadcasting dozen US college football games but couldn't show Cdn Bowl #shameful
2016-11-12 13:12:16,we got it going yest with a couple router reboots. Having to do another right now. Unsure why...
2016-11-12 13:12:00,I don't think so. I am live streaming on @CHYZ943 instead
2016-11-12 13:10:42,It's being televised by TVA Sports.
2016-11-12 13:07:50,@Shawhelp I have not had internet connection for 10 hrs now. I have reset my mobile devices and laptop but still no internet
2016-11-12 12:40:55,"odd issue, apparently if I turn off the option to see only HD channels I am able to select those channels again."
2016-11-12 12:39:50,it does.
2016-11-12 12:37:34,I had confirmation it's only shown on TVA sports (in French) It's available here in Wpg but I don't know if it is in Cgy
2016-11-12 12:35:56,"Thank you @Shawhelp for the prompt, patient & professional assistance in getting our internet up and running again!"
2016-11-12 12:31:11,perhaps you should calibrate your menu to reflect the correct kickoff time? Thanks.
2016-11-12 12:30:59,"just tried, no change"
2016-11-12 12:19:05,@Shawhelp any idea why I can’t choose shows on Global using the Gateway app? pic.twitter.com/VyEznqnwwp
2016-11-12 12:15:09,"the actual guide says that the Hardy cup is to be aired, but it's some program about the CFR #lame"
2016-11-12 12:10:35,That can't be right!
2016-11-12 12:05:46,@Shawhelp please bring the popular video streaming service @go90 to Canada
2016-11-12 12:03:32,@Shawhelp is the Hardy cup not being broadcasted? Trying to watch from Edmonton.
2016-11-12 12:03:16,it's being live streamed by Shaw & will be televised live on Shaw too! #WpgSantaParade
2016-11-12 11:41:11,thank you! A very patient and wonderful 4 year old appreciates it!
2016-11-12 11:29:45,@WpgSantaParade @Shawhelp will today's parade be available online/tv? I can't go now
2016-11-12 11:07:17,It's why we moved to Telus. So did Lars and Michelle.
2016-11-12 10:47:56,Weird. It just works on my smartphone. No registration/authentication needed. No complaints. I hope it'll keep working. :)
2016-11-12 10:14:43,"oh I did that, 4 times. Still not working."
2016-11-12 10:08:28,"try unplugging everything, way a few minutes then plug everything back in."
2016-11-12 10:01:54,"Hey @Shawhelp my wifi is not working at home. I've reset the box, but still no luck. Can you please try remotely!"
2016-11-12 09:59:47,waiting for the follow
2016-11-12 09:57:43,@Shawhelp my wireless router some times quits working. I have to unplug it and plug it back in for WiFi to work. It's an arris modem
2016-11-12 09:57:24,will do since it went out again.
2016-11-12 09:51:50,Maybe someone at @Tbaytel will like the business
2016-11-12 09:49:54,I got through right away. Usually wait an hour to get someone on phone. Obviously my business isn't cut out for you guy's
2016-11-12 09:49:51,My peak internet speed is 70kbps.
2016-11-12 09:48:43,want to cut off my cable. Spent another hour on phone with Patrick who refuses to get me somebody who speaks English and for once
2016-11-12 09:48:26,"Well, that's kind if my point!"
2016-11-12 09:43:39,(Internet connectivity lights**)
2016-11-12 09:43:00,it's back on. I just noticed two lights on the router were out until now. You might want to enquire.
2016-11-12 09:39:00,"Having a hell of a time with with our Shaw internet, just about to pull the pin on ALL Shaw services. @Shawhelp #TerribleService #NotHappy"
2016-11-12 09:37:42,finally it's across multiple devices. I can also login to the modem-access point without any problem.
2016-11-12 09:33:54,"I should add, it's Shaw wifi, not going through a third party modem"
2016-11-12 09:32:53,wifi. No way to test the wired connection. I tried both bands and it yields similar results.
2016-11-12 09:21:07,@Shawhelp any known problems in Nanaimo V9T 6A2? Access has been poor or just impossible for the last few hours. Have rebooted the modem.
2016-11-12 08:58:25,Excuse me @Shawhelp - I subscribe to over 200 channels and you're not showing the #DunsmoreCup today between the #1 and #2 CIS teams?
2016-11-12 08:46:39,"looking for bridge mode, not pass through..."
2016-11-12 07:41:13,@Shawhelp I have the 150mb plan and a hitron modem - how do I go about getting the modem put into bridge mode?
2016-11-12 05:47:45,@Shawhelp Can I use an universal remote to replace the one with my PVR ?
2016-11-11 22:20:09,@Shawhelp so my Internet is down again and my cable is still cutting in and out. I want answers to when this will be fixed please.
2016-11-11 22:14:28,alright thank you!
2016-11-11 22:04:03,@Shawhelp dm
2016-11-11 19:55:29,Thank you. I've written to them informing them of my decision.
2016-11-11 19:42:41,And that's the ATN Cricket Plus channel I'm talking about....
2016-11-11 19:41:53,@ShawInfo @Shawhelp You guys are insane. You've taken off #IndvsEng & have #SAvsAUS on. What gets you more money? I'm canceling.
2016-11-11 19:25:12,Thanks guys. Over WiFi. Will restart and hope that fixes the issue.
2016-11-11 19:19:11,@Shawhelp My internet is cutting out frequently. Downtown Calgary. Any other people affected?
2016-11-11 18:45:40,I couldn't've been clearer at the beginning of the chat. I'll help her sort it out. Probably with another company
2016-11-11 18:30:47,that's what I said but your reps feel differently
2016-11-11 18:10:41,ok
2016-11-11 18:01:52,ok
2016-11-11 18:01:36,yes
2016-11-11 17:50:57,for the HD PVR programs set for reminders don't switch to the channel.
2016-11-11 17:40:17,@Shawhelp set reminders aren't switching over?! What would be causing this?!
2016-11-11 17:26:42,people would be lining up to switch from @TELUS . They don't seem to care about their quality because there isn't competition
2016-11-11 16:59:55,"@Shawhelp Hello. Can you tell me why Sportsnet Pacific and Ontario are in SD, and I can't find the HD channels. Plz help"
2016-11-11 15:52:34,This is main home computer that is plugged directly into router. Which is plugged into Shaw modem.
2016-11-11 15:40:11,"@Shawhelp Hey guys, you having issues in the Kamloops area? Cause this is not what I am paying for... pic.twitter.com/NtT59wF0PY"
2016-11-11 14:56:43,@Shawhelp hi guys I sent a DM
2016-11-11 14:42:09,I'm using your modem for wifi
2016-11-11 14:31:05,@Shawhelp Hi! I have an issue with my wifi. It always shows I have 5 bars but the wifi keeps turning on and off. Please help! Thanks!
2016-11-11 14:07:23,"today it was at the intersection of No.3 Rd & Granville in Richmond, BC. Other is at Hugh Boyd Park where Shaw has outdoor Hotspot"
2016-11-11 13:57:17,"very spotty performance. Likely an issue with capacity on the network. Too many users, not enough bandwidth to handle them."
2016-11-11 13:47:28,thanks but if you actually read tweet you'd realize my mentioning failed cellular attempt meant I was talking about Shaw Go WiFi
2016-11-11 13:33:53,Is the store in oakridge open today?
2016-11-11 13:26:22,Need to trade my internet modem in 4 a new one and was told they were open today so I waste my time going down and they're closed
2016-11-11 13:22:54,well I went there 30 minutes ago and they were closed and the security guy for the building said they were closed today...?
2016-11-11 13:15:05,nah tried it multiple times
2016-11-11 13:01:53,@Shawhelp why do your channels freeze
2016-11-11 12:47:44,@Shawhelp is the shaw store in Vancouver shaw tower open today? The shaw rep I talked to yesterday said they are...?
2016-11-11 12:45:35,@Shawhelp my parents sat TV isn't working on two receivers. Is something down on your end?
2016-11-11 11:57:07,I agree but I don't get FOXNC142 and I have a pretty pricey (supposedly great channel package) bill every month
2016-11-11 11:49:45,And I've told you that I'm done - I've had too many issues with Shaw's billing and your service is far too expensive.
2016-11-11 11:43:44,"@Shawhelp you should really get rid of 220CNN replace it with 142FOXNC, CNN is awful and I don't think to many people watch it anymore"
2016-11-11 11:39:27,So @Shawhelp is apparently refusing to honour my credit because I'm cancelling cable. Garbage like this is why cordcutting is so prevalent. pic.twitter.com/FLEmS8Y7e0
2016-11-11 11:37:28,"Nevermind, your eCare tech support replied to my email really quickly. :D"
2016-11-11 11:35:17,"@Shawhelp I am getting some real bad lag in Sherwood Park, AB"
2016-11-11 11:33:51,"Shaw mobile Wifi uses to be great - automatic & seamless. For weeks now, it always asks me to login. Fix ur app! @Shawhelp @TELUS"
2016-11-11 11:33:20,my dad got really upset with this email. I'm just trying to figure out why he was sent this so I can explain it to him.
2016-11-11 11:31:41,@Shawhelp Why did we still get sent this email when we already got a confirmation on the date the tech was coming? pic.twitter.com/0MTBwn2KV5
2016-11-11 11:13:41,Do you have any reported outages in North Vancouver?
2016-11-11 11:04:52,. @Shawhelp Cable is cancelled.
2016-11-11 10:58:55,. @Shawhelp I'm on the phone with support now. Cable will be cancelled unless Shaw offers it to me for free.
2016-11-11 10:52:24,So @Shawhelp is charging me a fee they said would be waived for me as long as I'm a customer. Time to cancel my cable. :)
2016-11-11 10:41:08,right now service is working but in the last 10 mins it's cut out 3 times. Sometimes for only seconds sometimes for mins at a time

2016-11-11 09:29:09,@Shawhelp hi services went down over in South West Edmonton... Updates?
2016-11-11 09:16:09,can you repair America? I think it needs to be turned off and eventually back on again...
2016-11-11 08:20:23,Yup. Works on PVR. So can you let someone know it's not on free range? :-) I'll watch it on the PVR this once.
2016-11-11 08:17:31,I will check the PVR as soon as I can chase my son off of it. :-)

2016-11-07 14:50:44,it happens randomly in different locations and they all sometimes work or don't work at all.

2016-11-07 14:16:34,@Shawhelp why am I unable to connect to ShawOpen sometimes? Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't
2016-11-07 14:09:14,I just got off the phone support and there is an outage in West lethbridge. Waiting on my blinking modem :)

2016-11-07 08:30:26,@Shawhelp What's the average wait time... Been on hold for over 25 minutes
2016-11-07 08:17:59,@Shawhelp hi. Was informed by WWE that network subscribers in Canada are to recieve an online network login from cable providers. True?
2016-11-07 08:16:17,@Shawhelp Thanks for following! Mention me if you have any #yeg #realestate questions.
2016-11-07 05:17:52,@Shawhelp Thanks for the 15 min (& still going) reboot of my cable box this morning while i am watching TV. Yes I am up at 4:30am!!
2016-11-07 02:45:44,@Shawhelp why is your internet so inconsistent ???
2016-11-07 01:37:33,"I'm not sure if we've been put on a wait list, it was my husband that spoke to you. I'll ask him!"
2016-11-06 22:13:59,so 85% full it starts to delete? any way to get the deleted shows back?
2016-11-06 21:48:45,"when does it need new space? We delete as we watch,but some are saved for much later viewing."
2016-11-06 21:41:18,WTF. Why is my WiFi and internet down!??! @shawhelp
2016-11-06 21:08:02,at what volume does it start deleting programs?
2016-11-06 20:52:31,"found it, 85% used"
2016-11-06 20:50:35,where do I check that?
2016-11-06 20:17:11,"many recordings are older, untouched. where do I look for settings?"
2016-11-06 20:07:35,Did you watch @NHLJets on channel 47 @Shawhelp sorry jus saw ur tweet https:// twitter.com/jbryksa/status /795411068914843648 …
2016-11-06 20:04:02,"@Shawhelp my saved recordings of last seasons black list & arrow are disappearing, I have not seen them, can I get them back?"
2016-11-06 19:55:33,"Instead of being proactive about wifi connection issues @Shawhelp is reactive, doing nothing to compensate the current clients w/ the issue"
2016-11-06 19:34:47,OK. I'll try that in the morning and get back to you.
2016-11-06 19:33:47,"tried two ports. No signal, no lights."
2016-11-06 19:28:14,"I power cycled it, at which point we lost the Ethernet lights and Ethernet connectivity. WiFi started working after a few minutes."
2016-11-06 19:26:46,check the cables first
2016-11-06 19:25:04,looks like a @Shawhelp issue maybe. Found on TSN5
2016-11-06 19:23:30,@Shawhelp our Shaw provided router has stopped sending out Ethernet signals (only WiFi) should we just ask for a replacement router?
2016-11-06 19:18:15,"Trying now, thank you!"
2016-11-06 19:07:36,@Shawhelp Internet is unbelievably SLOW today!! What is the deal?
2016-11-06 18:28:42,@Shawhelp having lots of issues with Nat Geo and Showcase channel 241/256. Keep cutting out more than a week now!!
2016-11-06 17:53:03,seems to be working better today.
2016-11-06 17:47:18,I mean Rogers support is fast but they're a joke. Every time it's some new generic excuse as to why it's down.
2016-11-06 17:46:48,Ive done all the reset options already today (I read the article) so is it just me or is it all down? Wi-Fi AND Ethernet are down.
2016-11-06 17:45:03,"I'm using @Shawhelp and ever since I upgraded plans, the service has been amazing. Plus their help twitter is amazing."
2016-11-06 17:44:49,I just did a hard unplug reset. I'll try the next ones and report back.
2016-11-06 17:42:31,no thanks. Sportsnet is a joke. I don't want to pay for an extra channel for a game that's supposed to be nationally televised
2016-11-06 17:41:25,@Shawhelp what's going on with Sportsnet? Guide shows the Winnipeg Jets game should be on but all I'm getting is a score box?
2016-11-06 17:41:15,"@Shawhelp Surrey Newton, internet down since 11:00. Using data right now. Wasn't able to do homework"
2016-11-06 17:39:47,@Shawhelp is telling me to purchase sports net 360 so I can watch the first period
2016-11-06 17:38:53,@Shawhelp Still don't see the game. Even when Oilers are done. But I cant dm you pic.twitter.com/B3ZGTFLrD4
2016-11-06 17:38:29,"The PC is wired, can do wifi but i have a cable into it."
2016-11-06 17:38:10,"Clearly I don't get that channel as part of my overpaid cable package. I'm about done with cable, like the rest of the world."
2016-11-06 17:37:41,"@Shawhelp it's 630, the Oilers game is finished. The Jets game is still not on."
2016-11-06 17:36:34,sports net 360 channel
2016-11-06 17:36:28,how much will it cost me to add 360 ?
2016-11-06 17:35:55,Ok thanks.
2016-11-06 17:34:42,What channel is the #NHLJets game on for @Shawhelp customers?
2016-11-06 17:33:29,@Shawhelp why is the jets game not on ?
2016-11-06 17:31:39,so we are missing 1/2 the first period already! So disappointed!
2016-11-06 17:30:44,"@Shawhelp West Newton North, internet down since 11:00. Reset router a bunch of times, connected but no service."
2016-11-06 17:30:26,My snetWest is in black out too! I cant watch the game! pic.twitter.com/Q4iFNF9l1m
2016-11-06 17:28:37,what happens if that oilers game goes to OT? Why do you have 2 games that overlap? Doesn't that seem like a conflict?
2016-11-06 17:28:21,thank you. But still
2016-11-06 17:24:28,You ok with attending many events half an hour late??!
2016-11-06 17:24:21,@Shawhelp I live the wpg but cant watch the game!! Snet 360 is not available. What should I do?
2016-11-06 17:24:09,Yeah but come on. Not sure if this is a @sportsnet fail or @Shaw fail. But yeah just miss half an hour then it's fine?!
2016-11-06 17:23:12,@Shawhelp Unable to watch the jets game on Sportsnet! What's going on? Just getting the NHL Scoreboard :(
2016-11-06 17:22:35,@Shawhelp Snet360 not free with Shaw?
2016-11-06 17:22:05,and we already missed a goal -_-
2016-11-06 17:20:01,half hour late #mtswins
2016-11-06 17:19:41,Then @UtilityVoice it is on @TSN1290Radio
2016-11-06 17:19:02,@Shawhelp I cant view the game on sportsnet 360 either. I thought That was free with Shaw?
2016-11-06 17:17:12,This is really disappointing living in the region where Jets are supposed to be home broadcast. 360 costs extra here. Poor.
2016-11-06 17:17:11,"big surprise, Internet down again pic.twitter.com/yvuVCbDQbX"
2016-11-06 17:14:21,@Shawhelp it shows channel 47 in the guide but no game on the channel.

2016-11-06 17:12:50,@Shawhelp thanks for screwing me over for the Jets game. already started and not on. would have ordered a different channel
2016-11-06 17:10:20,Not everyone in WInnipeg has the others and there is NO reason for a BLACKOUT
2016-11-06 17:07:58,is it not on every other SN channel though?
2016-11-06 17:05:54,"@Shawhelp You are blacking out the Jets game on Sportsnet west, it is NOT suppose to be, It's airing on MTS"

2016-11-04 10:05:22,Direct ethernet is affected.
2016-11-04 10:02:57,That could be! Thank you for your response! Always good service with Shaw
2016-11-04 09:56:54,and they i keep getting channels are in free preview so i guess i am losing a bunch of channels for more money
2016-11-04 09:55:43,i've been thinking about this for awhile now shaw bill goes higher and higher and 7 bucks last month
2016-11-04 09:45:07,@Shawhelp Internet's gotten extremely slow suddenly. Is it something on Shaw's end or is it a problem on mine?
2016-11-04 09:42:33,Was on my guide. Said 10:30 start after the football game. All other channels were in normal central time?
2016-11-04 09:33:35,"did a power reset on modem, issue still not resolved"
2016-11-04 09:31:13,sure but I don't think that will help since TV is down too however the home phoneline still works. All services are under Shaw
2016-11-04 09:20:23,"@Shawhelp my Internet just went out, modem shows the sending and receiving lights blinking. Any idea what's wrong?"
2016-11-04 09:18:45,"of course, I have to remember how to be wired in (and find where I put the cord)... #millennial"
2016-11-04 09:13:35,the 2.4 was on channel 1. I've changed it to 11. What about the 5g? Seems to be all auto settings?
2016-11-04 09:09:39,can we change channels on the modem at all?
2016-11-04 09:08:22,2.4
2016-11-04 09:03:37,Ethernet is ok. Wireless is terrible
2016-11-04 08:53:22,We are new to the Shaw 150 plan. Why is our internet slower? It was faster on broadband 50.
2016-11-04 08:52:42,I'll check tonight between 9-10 when the problem has occurred every day for the last few weeks.
2016-11-04 08:47:56,"Loading is dreadful, very laggy"
2016-11-04 08:35:13,"have you tried turning off the ""Ask to Join Networks"" setting too? (in Settings-Wi-Fi)"
2016-11-04 08:34:13,I tried connecting to my shaw open well at a local coffee shop and this came up. Is it safe of should I not use it?? @Shawhelp pic.twitter.com/kmlPtGJdNp
2016-11-04 08:08:09,doing a speed test requires properly working internet - the heart of my issue.
2016-11-04 07:36:23,it was Cable. Randomly from an account 4 years of not being active there was a $418 bill that never should have existed.
2016-11-04 06:53:39,thank you!

2016-11-03 22:56:23,"Yeah, I saw that. Actually more expensive than the previous package I had!"
2016-11-03 22:28:56,you did this last year too. The info is often screwed up.
2016-11-03 22:22:15,It'd be super nice if @Shawhelp would stop throttling my wifi so I can do work uninterrupted.
2016-11-03 22:14:37,I got through! Thanks :D
2016-11-03 22:04:34,@Shawhelp hi! Are there no live chat agents for Internet support at the moment? Countdown timer hit 0 and I've been waiting for 15mins ):
2016-11-03 21:55:40,I can't believe I couldn't figure that out hahahaha! Guess not being a baseball fan has its consequences. Thank you!
2016-11-03 21:36:20,@Shawhelp tried taping a show twice yesterday as it showed new episode in guide description. Both times it was a rerun :(

2016-11-03 21:01:29,oh I think it's back. Yup after unplugging modem/router again it has now all come back. Thanks anyways
2016-11-03 21:01:10,you can lock into a contract - unlike Shaw which will arbitrarily increase fees (much love to Shaw social tm)

2016-11-03 20:57:00,no. But the internet source goes from the modem to a splitter then dispersed to various devices
2016-11-03 20:56:26,. An old modem? I guess that means it's time to call telus. I have been a stupidly loyal customer for 15yrs yet I have to ask?
2016-11-03 20:55:58,just sent DM with account info.
2016-11-03 20:53:25,I will. Thanks!

2016-11-03 19:42:10,Have tried several times with no improvement. 2 different routers tells me it's not at my end. Telus starting to look better.

2016-11-03 17:44:50,. @Shawhelp @Rogers Where the hell is the Canucks game??? I pay you both too much for it to be unavailable on all platforms.
2016-11-03 17:40:45,I'm in the same boat. If @Sportsnet does this regularly I might as well cancel and stream them.
2016-11-03 17:38:43,Hey @Shawhelp any idea on what channel is the Oilers game?
2016-11-03 17:38:39,"no,,,that's what I am watching. Also in issue with @sunterryjones !"

2016-11-03 13:01:23,@Shawhelp I get that you guys can only update the guide with what you're given but what's the point if it's not accurate?
2016-11-03 12:54:56,please respond! NHL centre still not working properly. Crippled by blackouts that @TELUS lets users watch. What am I paying for?

2016-11-03 03:05:23,Watching AMI? What you are hearing is a descriptive vocal assist for low or no vision viewers. Check audio settings>1/2
2016-11-03 02:14:02,"Still no help: crashes at the dinner scene in the hotel. Also ""pause"" and ""Ffwd"" buttons do not work."
2016-11-03 01:13:59,Man the amount I'm paying for shaw cable. I shouldn't have to be disconnected everytime there's a little wind @Shawhelp
2016-11-02 23:51:30,thanks! @albertagrrrl helped me solve the problem.
2016-11-02 23:31:56,random voice is Described Video… for visually impaired. Usually on specific channel. Sounds like an oops!!

2016-11-02 22:57:54,I have that too. Keep manually turning off the descriptive audio
2016-11-02 22:55:12,. @Shawhelp can you tell me why a random voice narrates everything I watch. It just started happening this week.No closed captioning on #yeg pic.twitter.com/2gDK5cEmfS
2016-11-02 22:27:24,@Shawhelp who goes over and above for clients? Justin from Nanaimo! Even got a follow up call. Never had service like that. Doubled my WiFi.

2016-11-02 21:29:26,I have the same problem with blind spot.
2016-11-02 21:26:32,OK so NBC right now is airing Blindspot but because you took over that channel to show Canadian content I'm missing Blindspot.
2016-11-02 21:25:29,"Ok now you just confused me. I believe the guide is correct, as it has been the past 4 to 6 weeks."
2016-11-02 21:24:29,some Channels now work. Missing some in SD and all HD channels. Other box works fine In both locations.
2016-11-02 21:23:00,"Also SVU has been on CTV2 for the past few weeks, not the main channel."
2016-11-02 21:22:11,it's been since 10:30 this morning for cable and 4:30 this morning for Internet
2016-11-02 21:21:46,Today is also Wednesday and that link you sent me shows the schedule for Monday.
2016-11-02 21:20:52,Since when? My PVR's been recording Blindspot for the past 4 weeks at this time. Are you saying it's been recording SVU instead?
2016-11-02 21:18:37,"yes, on the cable box it only says ""no ip"" on the motim it keeps flashing blue intake outake symbols"
2016-11-02 21:14:13,@Shawhelp just had the best customer service experience! chatted with Kasper V01B and that one experience will keep me as a client for life!

2016-11-01 23:11:11,I still can't believe that I have Shaw's fastest internet plan and still I have to turn my WiFi off because it's slow @ShawInfo @Shawhelp
2016-11-01 23:02:45,"As long as you aren't the one that made it that way, we're good :)"
2016-11-01 22:58:47,really wishin my TV had warriors games. get yourself together @Shawhelp
2016-11-01 22:56:02,sound is back. Turned off/on again. It was weird though
2016-11-01 22:53:45,"the shows are back, but the sound is gone"
2016-11-01 22:50:59,"I'd have to check. I know I've got a basic package for sixty bucks with internet, phone and basic cable."
2016-11-01 22:44:26,"I'm quasi watching, but I've seen this episode. You can reset it if you want. Or do I have to do it?"
2016-11-01 22:43:44,"Also, sending tweets like this and trying to stream things on sites like tubeplus takes forever"
2016-11-01 22:43:08,I've got the basic package and two things seem to happen. Logging on to websites like facebook takes an extra couple seconds.
2016-11-01 22:34:54,"Ch 11, 13, 28 & 77 show programs starting at 10 Ch 182 shows starting at 11"
2016-11-01 22:33:46,My @Shawhelp internet seems to be getting slower and slower. Maybe I oughta think about switching to Telus or something.
2016-11-01 22:32:20,"Already have. I am wanting to pay for an addon for unlimited bandwidth, but you no longer provide that. So I need someone who will"
2016-11-01 22:21:23,"apparently there is 'no current program' on Ch 15 (for example), yet I'm watching a rerun of Bull"
2016-11-01 22:16:13,"The thing is Ken, I love the plan I am currently on, the speed is amazing. It's just the bandwidth."
2016-11-01 22:04:40,"I know I shouldn't be surprised, but thank you for using ""affected"" properly and not ""effected"". It's soothing after internet-ing"
2016-11-01 22:02:00,Cool. Thanks Ken! Some of them aren't showing which programs are on now
2016-11-01 21:57:21,actually I did have one thing. I'll DM you guys.
2016-11-01 21:54:40,@Shawhelp where did the program names go for a bunch of channels? #disappeared

2016-11-01 21:38:32,thanks for the heads up. Thought I was going crazy and was just about to tweet you.
2016-11-01 21:27:50,. @Shawhelp Very quick customer service. NOT! pic.twitter.com/KTjr4mKtMk
2016-11-01 21:26:25,@Shawhelp Hey why is the internet down? It's been down for about an hour
2016-11-01 21:23:49,I felt the same when I was with Shaw. And if you left Shaw Dec 1 they wouldn't give you back that advanced bill....
2016-11-01 21:23:44,go through our last direct message from last week. Nothing has changed. I want a tech out to my house asap
2016-11-01 21:22:36,"@Shawhelp All my Shaw services are out (cable, phone, internet). is there an outage in signal hill SW?"
2016-11-01 21:19:02,we can't even watch Netflix without it lagging.
2016-11-01 21:17:29,weird. Ours is pretty much full speed here. Usually about 140 Mbps.
2016-11-01 21:14:35,within the last week
2016-11-01 21:14:18,. @Shawhelp Is your wait times longer because your internet 150 isn't even 10% as good as you say it is? #ripoff
2016-11-01 21:06:59,this only started happening since we got the new 150 plan.
2016-11-01 21:06:37,it's been on our wired connection s that we have noticed. Sometimes pages won't load or are very slow to load.
2016-11-01 21:05:28,. @Shawhelp This Internet150 is brutal. I want my money back. pic.twitter.com/5Z9pSWC21q
2016-11-01 20:59:12,"was just with ur CSR Tyler, did a bad job in assisting me. Ask me to do stupid steps but did not resolve the issue"
2016-11-01 20:56:16,Modem is online. Both television and internet are out.
2016-11-01 20:48:11,"Following you, but can't seem to DM u. Can't chat. Can't get thru via phone. I give up."
2016-11-01 20:47:07,@Shawhelp recently upgraded to the wide open 150 plan that included a new Hitron modem. I'm having issues with the internet stability
2016-11-01 20:42:02,just came back up on its own after about 3 hours down. Neighbors was out too so I think it was something else. Thanks Ken.
2016-11-01 20:41:26,@Shawhelp Is there an outage in SW Calgary?
2016-11-01 20:39:29,There are not specific sites. All internet access drops out for short periods. It is random.
2016-11-01 20:36:38,many in the area are complaining of slow or no connectivity. This is not an individual problem.
2016-11-01 20:34:48,"One example here. Sometimes they come up no issues, then suddenly this. Frequent issues, but not constant. pic.twitter.com/V0eKo3Ek14"
2016-11-01 20:32:56,"wired, not wifi/wireless"
2016-11-01 20:23:01,"CGNM-2250, power, up, down, @lights are all steady, device light blinking. Looks normal, essentially. Have the new 150."
2016-11-01 20:22:30,terrible internet service!
2016-11-01 20:21:53,ur internet is freakin TERRIBLE!!!
2016-11-01 20:21:26,Wired or wireless. Lots of complaints on the community FB page.
2016-11-01 20:21:10,I am also having the same issues. Seems maybe DNS related?
2016-11-01 20:17:54,@Shawhelp what's up with service in Tuscany (calgary) ?? 24+ hrs of sporadic connection. Can't 'chat' due to outage
2016-11-01 20:17:40,@WIND_Cares @Shawhelp and yes am getting irritated no-one seems to want to help my friend or me deal with a customer service issue #anyone ?
2016-11-01 20:16:32,"@WIND_Cares not sure if ur system is down but nearly 1.5hrs after I asked about customer service, still nothing? @Shawhelp"
2016-11-01 20:13:59,"@Shawhelp no connectivity near dtown Victoria. Tried cycling both modem/router, wired and wireless."
2016-11-01 20:12:27,"Most spd tests above the 150 we get. Xbox, YouTube, other sites very slow. Rebooted/reset router, tried other cables. DNS prob?"
2016-11-01 20:09:45,it's on 302 PPVhd
2016-11-01 20:07:47,same here in Tuscany. Service drops out randomly for a minute and then comes back. Been this way for a few days.
2016-11-01 19:55:54,"@Shawhelp Seeing a lot of tweets about internet probs in NW Calgary. Having the same issues for a day now, wired and wireless. Updates?"
2016-11-01 19:49:20,hi well so far no-one can give me the answer and even Google can't tell me
2016-11-01 19:47:00,Both.
2016-11-01 19:46:27,"it comes and goes. It's fine right now. When it goes again, or the 7th inning stretch, I will."
2016-11-01 19:45:41,You having different problems too! @Shawhelp
2016-11-01 19:44:16,Wireless
2016-11-01 19:43:05,I've had nothing but problems ever since getting the new modem for Internet 150. Constantly disconnecting. Furious
2016-11-01 19:41:36,I already spent an hour on the phone earlier.again wild situation. Paying for a service that doesn't deliver is no fun!
2016-11-01 19:38:43,"That update is for NE Calgary, not NW. I've been on hold for 47 minutes waiting to talk to someone. WTF"
2016-11-01 19:38:39,"all channels, only have one box."
2016-11-01 19:38:36,not the area of the city that I live in. I called around 6pm & did hard reset on modem worked temporarily!
2016-11-01 19:34:07,maybe you could 'advance bill' me for 2018 while you're at it?!?
2016-11-01 19:30:30,"@shawhelp severe pixellation (off and on, on right now) in Port Coquitlam."
2016-11-01 19:30:21,@ShawHelp Seriously!?!? Why did the #WorldSeries just get substituted by Modern Family!?!?!
2016-11-01 19:30:15,@Shawhelp any internet issue? In the 'Boyle street' area were experiencing some downturn currently! Seems like the 5G ain't working at all
2016-11-01 19:29:24,@Shawhelp seems a bit fishy that there are many problems w/internet in NW YYC but there seems to be no problems on your end?!? #frustrated
2016-11-01 19:22:24,Thanks Harvey. It's now working. #crisisaverted
2016-11-01 19:22:23,"I don't want to learn more, I want to not get billed a full month before service begins. That's shady"
2016-11-01 19:16:06,@Shawhelp hey is there any work being done in NW Calgary. Internet has been spotty yesterday and today.
2016-11-01 19:15:15,"thank you, it worked"
