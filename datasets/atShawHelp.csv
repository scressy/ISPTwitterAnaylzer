2017-11-10 12:00:55,Thanks. I will not be doing DM as you have already told me you can do any thing to help.
2017-11-10 11:55:14,What is a DM
2017-11-10 11:51:28,"So you are saying that you can not help me and I have to go back to Telus after all these years, because they could would not help me with a problem back then!!!"
2017-11-10 11:46:23,But then I have no internet for the computer that the hitron is set next to.
2017-11-10 11:43:15,Sorry did you miss my comment that said I cant. So how am I able to get this TV hardwired??? I have been with you guys for years and need someone to help me
2017-11-10 11:35:44,How can we enable it?
2017-11-10 11:32:57,But my house is fully developed so that does not work. Why is there a internet slot in the gateway if I can't use it ?
2017-11-10 11:27:47,Yeah I guess I could be. It is the one down stairs that it in my utility box
2017-11-10 11:25:13,My Son says I should be able to get it from the Arris down stairs

2017-11-10 11:00:14,Great.
2017-11-10 10:55:38,Just WiFi.
2017-11-10 10:53:00,"An ""expected results"" indicator in your speed tester wouldn't hurt."
2017-11-10 10:51:22,@Shawhelp my internet keeps dropping every few minutes. Is there some work being done? I've already reset the modem.
2017-11-10 10:42:37,"2 up, 4.5 down. I've been getting dropoffs as well. A reset of my modem seems to have dealt with the problem, as I'm not getting those bad results anymore, but I can't be certain of anything."
2017-11-10 10:35:17,"Troubleshooting requires knowing the cause, and I have no way to know what that is."
2017-11-10 10:30:30,@Shawhelp Saying my speed test results are lower than expected means nothing when you won't tell me WHY it's too low.
2017-11-10 10:24:05,@Shawhelp guess I'm going to @TELUS . Customer loyalty at Shaw means milk the cash cow
2017-11-10 10:20:19,"So can this impact the overall speed available to me? If there are enough Freedom users connected will I see an overall speed slowdown, wired and WiFi?"
2017-11-10 10:14:50,@Shawhelp https:// community.shaw.ca/docs/DOC-13441 will this be home and business internet modems affected by this update?
2017-11-10 10:01:43,@Shawhelp either a phishing attempt or you guys are sending out emails asking for payment information. Hope it's the former because I'm ignoring it. pic.twitter.com/b714dldOqB
2017-11-10 08:59:53,the resolution was determined to be a modem swap. Can't get an appointment till next week. So I'm going to go to a retail store today.

2017-11-09 20:14:34,"@Shawhelp Incredibly disappointed today after a second visit from your cable technician and still no cable. This time though, he cut our internet cable. Now we have no internet or cable. Offering cost and 20 dollars off really doesn't cut it when we work from home. #poorservice"
2017-11-09 20:07:50,"It changes so fast, 4, 5, & 6 were lowest for a minute. I did manage to get speed up on channel 4, hoping not have to do this again for a while. Thank you 4 ur help!!!"

2017-11-09 19:48:59,Got it up to 14mbps with fresh re-boot. Will look at channels next. As an aside I am doing this alot more than I use to - not really satisfied with Shaw!
2017-11-09 19:41:49,@Shawhelp Shaw needs to get their shit together I swear if my internet goes down once more before a midterm or essay
2017-11-09 19:41:47,Thanks for your help. Your suggestions worked.
2017-11-09 19:37:47,All is says is to re-boot. I've done that so many times already. I get 20mbps but 5 or 7 at $85/month?

2017-11-09 19:14:38,@Shawhelp are there internet service outages for the Windermere in South Edmonton?
2017-11-09 19:11:30,Will do. My downstairs tv works fine. Just the box upstairs having issues.
2017-11-09 19:08:31,Yes. Followed the on screen instructions. Then I get this. pic.twitter.com/T5InI3yGSQ
2017-11-09 19:08:14,@Shawhelp is the internet having issues in Sault Ste Marie?
2017-11-09 19:04:38,Talking to my TV is great but if it doesn't respond it doesn't matter. It's like having a teenager.
2017-11-09 19:02:56,We have had this issue several times in the last few weeks. It tells us to reset it. We try it and it takes several attempts but finally does reset. I like my old Shaw cable better.
2017-11-09 19:01:14,It tells me it is having issues connecting to the portal. I can continue watching the current program but not change channels or bring up the guide.
2017-11-09 18:56:55,@Shawhelp So everytime it snows or rains is my Shaw Bluesky going to not work properly??? Just curious.
2017-11-09 18:45:40,And the cable companies wonder why people are going to streaming. Show something we want.
2017-11-09 18:37:37,"Yea i called 220 bucks and i lost a month.There should be at least some game on! We live in canada, a hockey country! with many games on again and no access to any is pretty sad!"

2017-11-09 18:18:49,"Winnipeg, and another game blacked out. Actually all nhl games are blacked out right now. Bye Shaw ! If u can't have hockey i'm done! @Shawhelp"

2017-11-09 18:11:52,"Nope, they aren't. Top one is sold, second and last light are flashing. I've also tried rebooting several times."
2017-11-09 18:08:26,"@Shawhelp does Thunder Bay, Ontario have an outage for Internet?"
2017-11-09 17:47:55,Good evening. This gentleman may not be a customer. He is referring to a next door neighbour and a cable across his driveway that Shaw laid so it would be the cable team.
2017-11-09 17:04:20,"We don't seem to have any Shaw Direct Satellite TV accounts for this address. Are you perhaps with Shaw Cable? If so our colleagues at @Shawhelp can assist! We would also recommend deleting that tweet for your own safety, as these replies are publicly visible. *fpl"

2017-11-09 16:40:06,I unplugged it and it reset.... it just sucks that we have had to do this so often! We haven't even been compensated for all the issues we've encountered! Is that up to us to make you offer something?!
2017-11-09 16:31:27,@Shawhelp ??? Just documenting another glitch... pretty laughable now that we stay on as a customer pic.twitter.com/yVRj9wlQCk
2017-11-09 15:37:27,yes agreed. And this is a recent occurrence. I've been able to connect recently to hotspots here.
2017-11-09 15:31:14,I will see if it works at another hotspot. The problem seems to be that this hotspot is not asking/prompting for user info. Can't even change the config to enter it.
2017-11-09 15:25:33,"Galaxy s6. And yes, I've done ""forget network"" several times."
2017-11-09 15:20:31,"yes I can see ShawOpen but cannot connect. Says Authentication error, even though I haven't entered and can't enter my uid/pwd info."
2017-11-09 15:10:10,@Shawhelp currently having an issue with connecting to ShawOpen. Are there known problems in Nanaimo?
2017-11-09 15:07:03,@Shawhelp Troy in Winnipeg took my Shaw internet help phone call. He fixed the problem like a boss in seconds flat. He hardly said a word. Thanks Troy. #wificall

2017-11-05 16:45:55,@Shawhelp On your recommendation I changed my internet plan but I haven't picked up the new modem. Do I have to return the old modem?
2017-11-05 15:57:21,Wow people are so rude! Talk about 1st problems! Grow up & not get so “embarrassed” over the small things
2017-11-05 15:36:42,@Shawhelp your employees cutting people off doesn’t seem like professional practice. License plate KV 3650 at 2:25 today
2017-11-05 15:17:58,Yes we are! Is there an expected time for it to be back up?
2017-11-05 15:13:12,No internet here too! (West Edmonton)

2017-11-05 14:41:09,All it takes a manager to override. Don't lie to me Lance.

2017-11-05 14:31:19,"Thanks, Lance. I’m home now, but will try again, the next time I’m out and about. When asked for my username, is it the same as ShawOpen?"

2017-11-05 14:22:42,"@Shawhelp Trying to connect to Shawpoint WiFi, being asked for “Username” yet rejects mine, despite already being subscribed to ShawOpen?"
2017-11-05 14:17:20,I just checked on Shaw.ca and it appears that it is possible to order a brand new Gateway via online order for $348. Is that still true?
2017-11-05 14:12:43,"Okay, I will tell them, thanks. Is it possible to order a new Gateway from Shaw? She said she phoned Shaw and was referred to BestBuy."
2017-11-05 14:07:03,Interesting. So it would be pretty risky ordering online from BestBuy then? No indication of previous years of use. Says check with Shaw
2017-11-05 14:02:54,Apparently it's blacked out in BC. Silly NHL. Thanks for your help!
2017-11-05 14:00:15,"Excellent! Ps. If they buy the refurbished Gateway from Best Buy, what is the warranty? BestBuy said the warranty is with Shaw."
2017-11-05 14:00:06,Is it possible to watch on a laptop then? Or no?

2017-11-04 22:25:46,"That dog better not touch my remote, or it'll be in big trouble! No more carrots for him."
2017-11-04 22:24:14,"2 hours and 20 mins and it just came on, the last frickin fight! Wow @ShawInfo @shawhelp you better not charge us!"
2017-11-04 22:23:41,I have blue sky but I already paid for it when I ordered it. Will I get a refund? This has been a mess. I had a bunch of friends over for it
2017-11-04 22:23:34,"All good, started working awhile ago now but thank you"
2017-11-04 22:22:05,"Hey uhhh @Shawhelp fightee no workee. It’s the main event, plz fix"
2017-11-04 22:20:39,Brutal
2017-11-04 22:19:41,"what a joke of service ""we will credit you the fight"" well obviously you are not going to charge for a fight I didn't get @Shawhelp"
2017-11-04 22:18:53,So ooooooo... Still working on it?
2017-11-04 22:18:25,@Shawhelp my order of the ufc pay per view just froze before the main event.
2017-11-04 22:17:30,How long???
2017-11-04 22:16:43,@Shawhelp thanks for freezing & making me miss GSP's walk in!!!
2017-11-04 22:16:30,Kinda late I think. I suspect you won't be charging me.
2017-11-04 22:14:10,I will like to have a refund on my account.
2017-11-04 22:09:46,@Shawhelp how are you going to make this right? Customers wanted to and couldn't watch UFC 217!!
2017-11-04 22:09:24,@Shawhelp how come at least 3 times a day it says connection error contact shaw then a minute later the channel comes back
2017-11-04 22:09:17,"All good, problem resolved"
2017-11-04 22:06:25,"All kidding aside, is there even a chance this will be up? @shawhelp"
2017-11-04 22:06:16,@shawhelp any idea whats going on? I've replaced my splitter and coax. This is on 150 Package from New Westminster http:// shaw.speedtestcustom.com/result/47a55ed 0-c1de-11e7-b0f9-e7227c8578af …

2017-11-04 21:57:05,Uhhh @Shawhelp I think I just let you know. Give me a * #to a manager and we'll talk - as will all the other people gathered in my basement
2017-11-04 21:53:59,UNACCEPTABLE. Unless you can drastically lower our bills and FULL REFUND expect myself as well as im sure many others to switch to TELUS.
2017-11-04 21:50:25,Oh no... so sorry! One of the best ones I have seen in years!
2017-11-04 21:50:09,How?!
2017-11-04 21:48:58,Too late
2017-11-04 21:48:58,@shawhelp The main event on TSN is over. Can I have the UFC fight yet?
2017-11-04 21:45:40,@Shawhelp we're going to miss the fight aren't we? What's going on! pic.twitter.com/adDB5H4Myq

2017-11-04 21:42:56,How can we still not see the fights? We also got hung up by CS. Phone number 604 308 4698
2017-11-04 21:42:35,Any update on on when this is going to be fixed. I would still like to watch the last two fights
2017-11-04 21:42:09,Getting it to here bud
2017-11-04 21:39:26,Btw it's not just blue sky customers
2017-11-04 21:39:17,"Waste of time. Your ""investigation"" took an hour. Just had to charge on my iPhone instead. Better not be charged."
2017-11-04 21:38:34,@Shawhelp is there even a timeline? Cause it would be nice to know if I should order on the internet or wait until it is fixed.
2017-11-04 21:38:14,@Shawhelp missing the fights . hour later. pic.twitter.com/Vjd3lAWJdY
2017-11-04 21:37:42,"@Shawhelp dude, I'm trying to watch the GSP fight and your Bluebox is lights out. #YourePayinForThis #ShawMoreLikeNaw"
2017-11-04 21:36:24,No it says it’s have issues tuning to channel and something about my account.
2017-11-04 21:36:18,Yes just a loading screen on channel 601. Employee account....
2017-11-04 21:36:17,Just black screen and they say they are working on it.
2017-11-04 21:36:01,"Hey Shaw, absolutely NO EXCUSES FOR THIS ONE! For the $$$ you charge monthly you guys can't get a ppv going? Get your shit together!!! pic.twitter.com/Ub2oDuv5l1"
2017-11-04 21:35:53,a little late dont you think? Blusky bs. $170 a month and missed the ppv how do you make this up to me for my inconvevience.
2017-11-04 21:34:51,WHEN WILL THIS BE FIXED
2017-11-04 21:34:21,@Shawhelp I am one of the Blue Sky people that can’t get the fight. “on hold” guy is telling me to go to 300 or 324 - I don’t have those
2017-11-04 21:33:56,Oh no! Really good one!
2017-11-04 21:33:51,We have a house full of people too and no UFC! What the hell! Had to pay a sitter and Shaw won’t pay me back for that!!
2017-11-04 21:33:38,"@Shawhelp don't worry Shaw, we ordered through IOS. Better not be showing on our bill. Took an hour for an ""investigation"" still no resolve."
2017-11-04 21:32:35,Thanks but we called in and they said it was some back end issue affecting it for a majority of customers.
2017-11-04 21:31:42,It’s not some customer it’s everyone on your blueskytv!!! @ShawInfo @shawhelp
2017-11-04 21:31:35,Ugh!!! @Shawhelp where is my UFC fight?
2017-11-04 21:30:47,"@Shawhelp @Telus Hey Telus, hit me up, I need a new provider."
2017-11-04 21:30:36,On bluesky as well and not working. Cancelled it and just found a stream instead
2017-11-04 21:30:35,@shawhelp To Everyone looking for a refund. You have to contact THEM within 24-48 hours to get refund. They are not just giving us one.
2017-11-04 21:30:10,"Yeah she had to sign one. Telus just recently made it into my area, so switching for sure. We don’t have a contract."
2017-11-04 21:30:01,It’s been an hour and a half and still nothing! Come on @shawhelp
2017-11-04 21:29:24,"Me too, ordered it this morning. Can’t watch it. Guy on the Shaw “on hold message” is telling me to tune into 300 or 324 which I don’t have"
2017-11-04 21:29:15,They made blue sky peeps sign a contract
2017-11-04 21:29:11,Hey @ufc blame @shawhelp you didn't get my $60. I wanted to watch. #brutal #notimpressed
2017-11-04 21:28:28,Omg I was just thinking The Exact Same Thing
2017-11-04 21:27:33,wonder if @TELUS is having the same issuse as @Shawhelp who will not even reply to twitter phone or internet chat 1 hr 35 min still on hold
2017-11-04 21:27:32,How the fuck did you get it on!?
2017-11-04 21:26:55,@Shawhelp Hilarious! No UFC pay-per-view but Shaw just delivered my bill for the month. Thanks! So I guess billing works. #Disappointed
2017-11-04 21:26:26,@Shawhelp #FuckShaw
2017-11-04 21:25:59,Shaw is brutal. Worse service I have ever experienced @Shawhelp #shaw #ufc #switchingtotelus
2017-11-04 21:25:41,@Shawhelp what's going on? This is stupid we paid for this
2017-11-04 21:25:26,"He already got it working with your help, about 40 minutes ago. Thanks!"
2017-11-04 21:25:23,@Shawhelp Shaw chat wait is 31 hours.....hmmmmmm. You guys are a piece of SHIT!!!! Fuck You!
2017-11-04 21:24:24,Yeah. We did too. Missed 80 minutes tho.
2017-11-04 21:24:18,To think we just switched to BlueSkyTV then this?? Seriously epic fail @shaw
2017-11-04 21:22:21,Tryna watch the @ufc ppv but @Shawhelp pooped the bed.
2017-11-04 21:21:55,It’s a bluesky issue. My sis in law has bluesky and it’s not working. I have the old box and it works. Still switching to Telus after this!
2017-11-04 21:21:32,@Shawhelp what is happening with our ufc tonight
2017-11-04 21:21:03,Thanks @Shawhelp ordered ufc 217 havent seen 30 seconds of the ppv yet
2017-11-04 21:20:51,Blue Sky? More like Blue Cry.
2017-11-04 21:20:38,"@Shawhelp So, is a fix on the way for #ufc217 ? I ordered it yesterday no problem, but am now seeing black."
2017-11-04 21:20:14,No luck for me either!! @Shawhelp What the hell!?!?
2017-11-04 21:19:13,@Shawhelp any word on when the fix will be?
2017-11-04 21:18:40,"Okay, I've Got A Bunch Of Very Unhappy People Here... Uncluding Myself... Hopefully Something Is Done, If This Isn't Resolved.."
2017-11-04 21:18:18,Just got Blue Sky to not watch UFC 217. Great job.
2017-11-04 21:17:50,@Shawhelp at this point you should be giving it away for free. This is ridiculous
2017-11-04 21:17:25,"Well apparently Telus is in our area now, so this justice our decision. We will be switching."
2017-11-04 21:16:59,Can't even watch it cause @Shawhelp has issues
2017-11-04 21:16:29,Hey @Shawhelp can you please get your shit together? Biggest #UFC event of the year and once again #BlueSky is garbage #Refund #TelusSwitch
2017-11-04 21:16:28,@Shawhelp Brutal pay-per-view service w/ Shaw tonight for UFC12. 8 people over. Custom UFC belt up for grabs. NO FEED! #Disappointed pic.twitter.com/JMLy1U7J9C
2017-11-04 21:16:03,So more than an hour into fights. On hold for 66mins. PPV still hasn’t loaded. Better not be charged for this BS. Thanks for nada @Shawhelp
2017-11-04 21:15:02,@Shawhelp Found a fix guys. Cancel Shaw services order @TELUS services
2017-11-04 21:13:27,We gave up and ordered it online. No patience for poor service when it's an event like this.
2017-11-04 21:12:30,Same issue for me too. Had to run out to the nearest pub. Better not be charged for it.
2017-11-04 21:11:47,We have a house full of people here. No PPV. This is fun. Thanks for ruining the night Shaw.

2017-11-04 21:10:54,Stupid new Shaw box/program they have licensed from a US company pretty sure
2017-11-04 21:10:21,Yup.
2017-11-04 21:09:38,Great!!! So we basically can't watch a fight we paid for? No issues with the last ppv we ordered so what changed ???
2017-11-04 21:09:21,Is blue sky some sort of fancy meth?
2017-11-04 21:09:08,Surprised
2017-11-04 21:09:03,Will you replay it for all of us that are missing it!!!
2017-11-04 21:08:50,So we are getting it for free then??
2017-11-04 21:08:41,Shaw support chat just decided to disconnect on me after sending me a link to the support page...that's fun.
2017-11-04 21:08:41,Blue sky always f’s up —
2017-11-04 21:08:32,@Shawhelp I sent a direct message. Just wanted to make sure I’m not getting charged for the UFC fight as I can’t access it
2017-11-04 21:08:03,@Shawhelp start streaming it for us to watch
2017-11-04 21:07:50,No actually.
2017-11-04 21:07:34,Yup same here. Super pissed off
2017-11-04 21:07:15,Blue sky is the worst provider I’ve ever had. So disappointed and can’t wait to get out of my contract
2017-11-04 21:06:58,Is there any hope it will be on before the end of the fights? I'm still expecting a full refund either way
2017-11-04 21:06:37,Not a good start to our “new” BlueSky experience!
2017-11-04 21:06:37,Please check your dm
2017-11-04 21:06:13,@Shawhelp Same issues here. Bluesky not getting a signal even though order was confirmed
2017-11-04 21:06:13,Did you try turning it off and turning it back on?
2017-11-04 21:06:05,I have a feeling we are all on blue sky—
2017-11-04 21:05:48,@shawhelp will be shopping at telus tomorrow. #sad . You wont even reply to a blusky customer or answer your phones

2017-11-04 21:05:31,Are you on blue sky?
2017-11-04 21:05:26,"There better not be any charges on my bill.... Your crap gateway and internet act up constantly, getting charged will be it for me."

2017-11-04 21:04:38,@Shawhelp Can you please help me access the GSP fight? Getting black screen. Thanks!
2017-11-04 21:04:26,We better not have to pay for this... already missed an hour of the fights
2017-11-04 21:04:23,And everyone here knows it’s gonna take 4-6 months to fight them to take the charges off
2017-11-04 21:04:16,I guess you don’t reply to people that have already dmd you?

2017-11-04 21:03:38,@Shawhelp HOW DO YOU GUYS LET THIS HAPPEN WITH YOUR PAPER VIEWS!?!?!? THIS IS NOT A GOOD LOOK!!
2017-11-04 21:03:22,No point in waiting anymore! Let me know if there will be refunds.
2017-11-04 21:03:14,I ran home because we have an old box and it worked... I ditched the party to come home and watch it. They are going to have to refund a lot
2017-11-04 21:02:31,"Oh also while thinking about it, the number your screen tells me to call (1-844-622-7429) is out of order, in case you weren’t aware..."
2017-11-04 21:02:26,There's no order button anymore. We've tried everything and after an hour on hold we hung up. Read that Shaw is telling people to just wait
2017-11-04 21:02:18,Still not working! Tried everything!
2017-11-04 21:02:10,Same here. @shawhelp
2017-11-04 21:02:09,@shawhelp really crapped the bed with this one... PPV is already an hour in and I’m sure 1000’s of people have houses full and no #UFC217
2017-11-04 21:01:49,I’m in the same boat. Black screen.
2017-11-04 21:01:09,I've given up on shaw and ordered on iOS. I'll be expecting a refund if I see a charge on my bill.
2017-11-04 21:01:07,"So, full refunds for this disaster? This is embarrassing."
2017-11-04 21:00:57,It better not be on the bill...
2017-11-04 21:00:39,"Don’t even bother I don’t want it even if it comes up, we are going to a bar in town that has it now"
2017-11-04 21:00:24,Come on!!!
2017-11-04 21:00:06,@Shawhelp Jesus Christ it’s been a hour and the UFC isn’t on yet
2017-11-04 20:59:39,@Shawhelp why are some of my subscribed channels not appearing in my Free To Me guide? All my Time Shift channels.

2017-11-02 09:53:52,Why black it out. Thought you had a licence to broadcast????
2017-11-02 09:52:05,Do you really think shaw gives a crap!!! Not likely!
2017-11-02 09:28:50,Got overcharged by Shaw and have to get credit because of it ... hopefully it's finance dept. Will approve a refund @Shawhelp
2017-11-02 08:34:42,download is at 4 where it should be 20?? It's been like this forever I'm getting jipped. It's a game on my ps4.
2017-11-02 08:30:31,@Shawhelp Why the hell does it take 17hrs to download a 50gb file huh? I've tried to get assistance dozens of times but no change hello?????
2017-11-02 08:21:43,Exactly!!
2017-11-02 08:10:16,Thanks!
2017-11-02 06:50:46,@Shawhelp when will the fireplace channel make an appearance?
2017-11-02 05:12:09,You mean you’re missing the Penguins game
2017-11-02 04:11:49,Snow Very wet & heavy ...Snow! VERY windy too. Glad we switched to @Shawhelp . Even if we DON'T get all the HD channels #NoSignalLoss #fb
2017-11-02 01:27:42,"@Shawhelp DS light is off, US light is flashing on modem. Tried unplugging power, coax and using reset button. Is it something on your end?"
2017-11-02 01:18:23,Dammit @Shawhelp I was 5 minutes from the end of that episode when the internet died. Could you please time your outages better. Thanks.
2017-11-01 23:38:02,@Shawhelp is your server down? I'm in the Winnipeg maples area and the modem seemed to have just stopped sending ping.
2017-11-01 23:32:30,. @Shawhelp there any outages in Winnipeg or is it just my internet?
2017-11-01 23:29:03,fuck you @Shawhelp
2017-11-01 23:14:17,Hahaha different kind of stress. Next 10 games are crucial
2017-11-01 23:11:09,Tell me if this is also your experience. Being an Oilers fan has been way more stressful than raising an infant child.
2017-11-01 22:47:35,@cnoelmedia Lenny: automated responses to telemarketers https://www. reddit.com/r/itslenny/ Now we need one for calls to @Shawhelp
2017-11-01 22:26:32,Feels bad when shaw gets blamed for the nhl's blackout restrictions
2017-11-01 22:19:01,Or a problem with the TV or PVR for the same reasons.
2017-11-01 22:18:30,I honestly don't think it's the signal. I do not think I've ever seen this issue on CBC. It doesn't happen with any other show or sport.
2017-11-01 22:15:27,I need a 2-1 canucks win because my fantasy team has Markstrom and Hirscher
2017-11-01 22:13:19,It only seems to be Sportsnet related. I'll wait until a game is on both CBC and a SN and see if I can't determine if it's the channel.
2017-11-01 22:07:00,Doesn’t help one bit when you thought you recorded Canucks game on sportnet and then find out you have recorded the World Series twice#telus
2017-11-01 22:05:35,"Also, despite my having done nothing to the cable or the TV it seems to have ceased doing it."
2017-11-01 22:05:01,"This happened to me too, infuriating!"
2017-11-01 22:04:55,"Funnily enough, we do not have any other boxes in the house, not sure why you always think we do."
2017-11-01 22:01:48,It’s called game 7 of the #WorldSeries2017
2017-11-01 21:54:02,Unfortunately the PVR is suffering anyway and cannot be relied on to show even the non jerky play reliably.
2017-11-01 21:53:24,"It happens all over the ice, but is reasonably guaranteed to happen each time the play crosses through the neutral zone."
2017-11-01 21:52:00,Yeah I saw your tweet and went on the hunt and also found it!
2017-11-01 21:46:04,@Shawhelp I just got my bill for the month and it says I ordered a UFC event that I never watched. Why would I order a month old event?
2017-11-01 21:41:12,Each of the first 3 or 4 times I've brought it up with you all. It happens just too often at the same spots on the ice to be the connection
2017-11-01 21:39:18,That was the last straw @Shawhelp I'm switching to @TELUS tomorrow. For real.
2017-11-01 21:39:10,Ended*
2017-11-01 21:39:03,"I finally got it, after the Oilers game end."
2017-11-01 21:38:31,"I'm in Van. If you don't have an alternate channel, you won't see the game tonight. Yet the World Series are on all the channels."
2017-11-01 21:38:22,I PVR the @EdmontonOilers game on @Shawhelp ch 23 @Sportsnet cuz that's what guide said. Instead it's a fucking MLB game. Who's to blame?
2017-11-01 21:35:41,"...speed and cuts frames or something, but I have no setting like that set. I'm fairly sure that it gets sent by you or Sportsnet this way."
2017-11-01 21:34:27,It's nothing to do with that. The TV has no other signal problems on any other channels. It is possible that the TV can't handle...cont...
2017-11-01 21:28:16,@Shawhelp . You must be part of the a government sector. Cause you don’t do anything and charge me $250/month. I hate u!
2017-11-01 21:22:28,@Shawhelp the Canucks game on 302 is doing that jerky movement thing that I've been complaining about.
2017-11-01 21:21:37,"As soon as the Oilers/Penguins game ended. ""Last minute changes"" #pathetic @Shawhelp"
2017-11-01 21:20:47,You people are Stellar and Wonderful TYVM
2017-11-01 21:17:01,"Hey there, it's on SN Vancouver tonight. Here's where you can find it: http://www. sportsnet.ca/schedule pic.twitter.com/UYUVSbBfbI"
2017-11-01 21:15:25,@Sportsnet @Canucks @Shawhelp trying to watch Canucks vs Devils...what channel #joke #sad
2017-11-01 21:11:21,Okay.
2017-11-01 21:10:41,"Ok it is what it is, sorry for being snarky I love my Canucks!"
2017-11-01 21:09:39,What channel @Shawhelp @Canucks
2017-11-01 21:07:17,Would love to watch the Devil's decimate the Canucks. Shame.
2017-11-01 21:03:31,Just a notice of blackout restrictions. No need to show Leafs on multiple channels and screw Canuck fans. #comeonman
2017-11-01 21:01:37,Way to go Shaw you screwed us again. I PVRd the wrong game thanks to you. Why do you keep doing this? Get your act together
2017-11-01 20:57:52,"Yeah, sorry, I misread. That sucks."
2017-11-01 20:57:26,@Shawhelp I just got CraveTV thru Shaw. Can I access it on my laptop when not at home?
2017-11-01 20:57:24,Hahaha no worries
2017-11-01 20:57:15,Yeah but you're in BC. It's not available for people outside of BC.
2017-11-01 20:56:58,"That's ridiculous! My on tv guide shows the game on Sportsnet 360. Multiple channels showing Leafs game, so that's B.S."
2017-11-01 20:56:56,Nope sorry I misunderstood your question.
2017-11-01 20:56:34,I've got it showing as channel 22 at 8.
2017-11-01 20:54:17,
2017-11-01 20:53:50,Yes. Which is a Vancouver/BC channel
2017-11-01 20:53:33,20 channels are playing the damn world series and I can't have one that I pay extra for. Utter bullshit.
2017-11-01 20:52:12,In the past when there was schedule issues they put the game on PPV channel
2017-11-01 20:49:53,Looking for this game in Sask. Not necessary to show the damn Leafs on multiple channels is it? Where is the Canucks game I paid for?
2017-11-01 20:47:05,Unacceptable! You’ve screwed us again Shaw. Shame on you.
2017-11-01 20:46:38,It's on Sportsnet Vancouver Hockey
2017-11-01 20:45:32,I'm a huge #Devils fan and this is completely unacceptable. Why am I paying for it??
2017-11-01 20:45:15,nope
2017-11-01 20:45:11,"How is it that in an era of 5 TSN channels and 127 SN variations, there are any blackouts. Especially in the fantasy sports era we live!"
2017-11-01 20:44:04,I experience this multiple times a year and it gets old really quick. Blackouts are complete crap
2017-11-01 20:43:09,So I had plans and people over to watch the game that was advertised. This crap is why people don't pay for cable anymore
2017-11-01 20:43:04,Telus too girl. Pissed.
2017-11-01 20:42:31,I was told I could watch it on freerange tv. I don't pay $54 a month to watch games on my phone
2017-11-01 20:41:59,@Shawhelp tell me this isnt for real. We cant get the first period of @canucks games now ?
2017-11-01 20:39:47,@Shawhelp complete bullshit advertising games on subscribed channels then changing programming and blacking out other options for game
2017-11-01 20:38:59,So I need to move to B.C. to watch the Devils play? Ok...
2017-11-01 20:34:54,@Sportsnet @Shawhelp @Canucks get your collective shit together and stick to a channel for Canucks games... #brutal #Idiots
2017-11-01 20:34:41,Then make 360 free tonight. Simple fix.
2017-11-01 20:33:04,Are you serious?
2017-11-01 20:32:59,"Hey @Shawhelp , your guide info is wrong. Game is listed on incorrect channels. I Found it on 302 because of this tweet."
2017-11-01 20:32:32,@Sportsnet @Shawhelp ok sports companies. Make this a channel. But get rid of the background and make it full 16*9 ratio #pipwasamazing pic.twitter.com/3cIRIpqGs3
2017-11-01 20:32:26,Please read back my tweets and you might understand my frustration.
2017-11-01 20:31:29,And stream is screwed by @ShawHelp . You guys really need to fix your http:// twitch.tv issues.
2017-11-01 20:30:49,World series is on multiple channels already. Wwwhhhyyy bump the oilers??
2017-11-01 20:30:33,"I know it’s not your call, but that’s SO dumb."

2017-11-01 20:27:31,Hmm haven’t the leafs lost 3 in a row
2017-11-01 20:27:28,Center Ice blacks out your local team.. Otherwise everyone would dump @Shawhelp & @TELUS
2017-11-01 20:27:16,i can't find the game in Vancouver either
2017-11-01 20:26:22,@sportsnet @Canucks @Shawhelp Tough to sell your product when we cant watch the damn game? No #leafs in this house!
2017-11-01 20:25:12,HEY! 302 & 326 is dead air! I live in AB and paid for Centre Ice to watch the Canucks. Wasn’t an issue vs Dallas Monday. Fix this now.
2017-11-01 20:24:42,Hahaha are you guys even going to make the playoffs this year....
2017-11-01 20:24:21,Thanks for this! :) Couldn't get it on 326 and couldn't find it anywhere else.
2017-11-01 20:22:42,Canucks/Devils.
2017-11-01 20:20:18,Sent you a PM but found it on 328. Thanks! :)
2017-11-01 20:20:15,I ended up on mango tv
2017-11-01 20:17:27,Still not sold until they can get out of he first round of the playoffs #bruins
2017-11-01 20:16:32,"So... the game won't be shown on Sportnet, which I pay for, nor the NHL cable package, which I also pay for? Nice."
2017-11-01 20:16:25,Well that channel is not working at my place. I thought it would be that channel. Can you help?
2017-11-01 20:16:22,302 and 326 are both blank in Edmonton saying Not Subscribed (I do have the ice pack).
2017-11-01 20:16:16,Liars. Where the hell is the Oilers game???
2017-11-01 20:15:11,302 tells me I'm not subscribed to that channel.
2017-11-01 20:15:05,Im missing my game for some wack ass sport that nobody cares about atm... and gamecentre wont let me stream because its broadcast locally
2017-11-01 20:15:03,360 should be enabled on a free preview then for tonight in Alberta
2017-11-01 20:15:02,It's on 328
2017-11-01 20:14:42,How uninformed are you? It's on SN360. Guide says Devils vs Canucks and no subscription necessary. I give up. @shawnohelp
2017-11-01 20:14:12,Tried all of them and nada.
2017-11-01 20:14:06,Apparently its only showing up on SNP and SN360... i went through the whole guide even ppv and whatnot...
2017-11-01 20:13:58,Hahaha Nate you know the Leafs are the truth...
2017-11-01 20:13:57,Thank you
2017-11-01 20:13:08,I'm in Manitoba... nothing but dead air on both 302 and 326.
2017-11-01 20:12:54,Thanks! We were floundering!!
2017-11-01 20:12:33,. @Shawhelp HELP! Which channel is the #Canucks game on for centre ice subscribers?
2017-11-01 20:12:18,@Shawhelp where is the Canucks game? Says Canucks vs Devils and the Oilers game is on pic.twitter.com/i1nOUCYxWz
2017-11-01 20:12:00,@Shawhelp guide says it on 223 but Baseball game is on. So because sportsnet changed things I'm out of luck?
2017-11-01 20:11:54,Leafs a Trash ting fam
2017-11-01 20:11:16,Go Leafs Go
2017-11-01 20:10:55,I absolutely loathe people selling stuff door to door. @TELUS @Bell @Shawhelp stop this or I will never buy from you & will sell my shares
2017-11-01 20:10:16,Where’s the Canucks game? It was supposed to be on 360!
2017-11-01 20:08:47,What about the Devils/Canucks?
2017-11-01 20:08:28,U people had this so screwed up this evening. Time to look at an alternative provider. Fed up with inaccurate guides. And I PAY ENOUGH!
2017-11-01 20:07:13,@Shawhelp where is the Canucks game on Shaw for people not in BC?
2017-11-01 20:06:21,What channel is the Oilers game on. @Shawhelp
2017-11-01 20:04:47,blank screen. :(
2017-11-01 20:04:34,"Don't have 302 and it says I have to subscribe for 326. I've been able to watch it on 326 before without a problem. ""Info"" just gives me a"

2017-11-01 19:53:04,Can I get a follow for dm’s
2017-11-01 19:50:38,So how do I get 360?
2017-11-01 19:49:27,@Shawhelp Not everyone wants to give you more money for less and less - Oilers game on SN360 that I don't want to pay for. Boo Shaw!
2017-11-01 19:47:42,Thanks mate!
2017-11-01 19:47:30,Yeah not quite sure what in paying for these days. And I have a pretty robust package.
2017-11-01 19:47:01,You guys suck! Who cares about a baseball game between 2 teams thousands of miles away.
2017-11-01 19:46:51,Everyone can direct their displeasure to feedback@sportsnet.rogers.com @sportsnet
2017-11-01 19:45:56,@Shawhelp any help getting the oilers game tonight? I have sports net but can’t find the game anywhere
2017-11-01 19:45:15,Dealt with Lance many times #AlwaysPrompt via DM’s

2017-11-01 19:44:36,I guess we'll fine out in 15 minutes
2017-11-01 19:43:45,That's great... now call @shawhelp and get them to unlock the channel since we should have been able to watch this game without subscribing
2017-11-01 19:42:42,"I'm just having a rough night and wanted to relax by watching my favorite team play, but now my night is just more stress."

2017-11-01 19:41:01,Is there any other way to watch it other way than to pay for it? I'm quite annoyed that they are prioritizing poker and baseball over hockey
2017-11-01 19:40:31,I would some pissed off if I had PVR’s a game and it was on the wrong channel... the only reason that have satelite. Not impressed
2017-11-01 19:40:27,+A to @Shawhelp great customer service
2017-11-01 19:39:33,Thank you! I’m so tired of Shaw’s guide not being correct.

2017-11-01 19:35:35,SN360 has it.
2017-11-01 19:35:08,anything now? I'd like to get this fixed
2017-11-01 19:34:57,I got it back by connecting to my 5Ghz connection. Maybe just too much interference tonight.
2017-11-01 19:34:41,Literally have four channels that say the oilers game is playing on the @Shawhelp guide but not a single one has the game on.
2017-11-01 19:34:24,Sent!
2017-11-01 19:33:52,Frustrating
2017-11-01 19:33:36,Shaw should turn on SN 360 for all Edmonton customers for the game?
2017-11-01 19:31:44,@Shawhelp @Canucks i believe the game is being played on channel 231 (SN360). Not 302! correct me if I'm wrong/insane
2017-11-01 19:30:32,"So I guess I can't watch the #EDMvPIT on Shaw TV, remind me again why I have Shaw again @Shawhelp"
2017-11-01 19:30:26,not sure why I have sent it twice and I don;t' really want to put all my private information on here
2017-11-01 19:29:55,But you could @Sportsnet that your client base is less than happy!
2017-11-01 19:29:03,"I’m in the car,just dropped off grandsons football gear and listening to between period chat on CHED...grrr"
2017-11-01 19:29:03,Same issue as everyone else here. What an absolute joke.
2017-11-01 19:28:37,Don't brother they are not showing the #Oilers
2017-11-01 19:27:17,@Shawhelp are you heading of any outages downtown Calgary? No internet here.
2017-11-01 19:26:27,Seriously @sportsnet @Shawhelp why is game not on sportsnet west. @EdmontonOilers is the only reason I pay for the sportsnet. Baseball
2017-11-01 19:25:37,@Sportsnet could have placed it on regional channels! Or on the special local Sportsnet channel like they do when Oiler/Flame sametime
2017-11-01 19:25:17,that's crooked. Just stop fishing for money as a company and fix it.
2017-11-01 19:24:16,"@Shawhelp Thank you, Shaw. The non-functioning wi-fi near Starbucks, Broadmead Mall, Victoria, is now fixed!!! I can tweet again!"
2017-11-01 19:24:07,sent
2017-11-01 19:24:06,Thats great for people who have shaw360... however i don't..
2017-11-01 19:24:03,"I see that, but you want extra money for that channel. SO, I don’t have it !That is what is BS"
2017-11-01 19:23:43,Disappointed-don't have SN360-premium.The #EDMvsPIT game was listed as being on my basic service-SN1. Listening on @630CHED -gr8 announcers

2017-11-01 19:22:19,"I don’t subscribe to this channel, so now I can’t watch it? Ridiculous. SN360 never has Oilers games on it. @Shawhelp @Sportsnet"
2017-11-01 19:21:04,I need sports net 360. I’m missing the @EdmontonOilers game @Shawhelp
2017-11-01 19:20:00,"Also others are able to get the game in SD on 121 without subscription, but we don't."
2017-11-01 19:19:16,Still doesn't make sense they're showing plays of the month over current gameplay on Sportsnet One.
2017-11-01 19:14:45,@Shawhelp what channel is the pens oilers game?? It's all baseball
2017-11-01 19:14:07,"When channels r sampled for subscription it’s free for a wknd, can this work for the game? Will it be replayed?"
2017-11-01 19:14:02,@Shawhelp why is the TV guide saying that the @EdmontonOilers are playing on sportsnet1 yet there a poker game on??
2017-11-01 19:13:51,Yeah with internet 150
2017-11-01 19:13:26,"@Shawhelp I have no phone service, my phone says check tel line, whats up?"
2017-11-01 19:13:25,This is BS. meanwhile I can watch plays if the month??? WTF.
2017-11-01 19:13:08,"Ok, thanks"
2017-11-01 19:12:39,There were last-minute changes in Sportsnet's programming that came in too late to update the Guide. Pls DM for help finding a show! *fpl

2017-11-01 19:05:22,. @ShawHelp Thank you to your guy Lance. This is the first time (of four) that I've been locked out of @WWENetwork & gotten prompt assistance
2017-11-01 19:04:39,That is garbage... put the premiere game of the week on a premium channel. Guess this is why I'm cutting the cord.
2017-11-01 19:04:36,@Shawhelp if you don't fix the oilers game on shaw your about to lose 1million peoples business...
2017-11-01 19:04:14,Gee thanks

2017-11-01 19:02:28,You do realize that it's Crosby vs McDavid and that that's more important than poker and baseball to the majority of Canadians right?
2017-11-01 19:02:14,@Shawhelp so you guys moved the oilers game to a channel I’m not subscribed to. Not happy and I think I’m done with Shaw.
2017-11-01 19:01:53,You basturd
2017-11-01 19:01:15,Good pick up with rabbit ears in Sherwood park !

2017-11-01 18:55:28,@Shawhelp @Sportsnet What channel is the Oilers game on tonight? All of the channels that list Oilers Vs Pens have poker or the World Series
2017-11-01 18:53:06,"So no ""free"" TV"
2017-11-01 18:52:34,It's not there. Just bars. And there's no blackout as it's in SNW ON REG CABLE. This is not satisfactory as I pay for Free range.
2017-11-01 18:51:36,Thanks!
2017-11-01 18:50:49,@Shawhelp https:// twitter.com/jaycole1977/st atus/925887701772935168 …

2017-11-01 18:48:18,"My cable guide is wrong. Trying to find the Oilers game, and every channel it says it should be on is just baseball."
2017-11-01 18:47:51,"@Shawhelp so I know the oilers game is on SN360, but I don't have those channels! Will the game be on the normal channels after poker?"
2017-11-01 18:46:30,Thx!
2017-11-01 18:46:28,I finally found it on 121 which is listed poker!! Baseball is on the xhannels@listed for hockey
2017-11-01 18:46:11,@Shawhelp I don’t get 360 it’s in a different package. When I signed up I was told I would get all the oiler games...
2017-11-01 18:45:41,@Shawhelp @EdmontonOilers hey where's the @OilersNation game on SHAW
2017-11-01 18:45:36,I don’t have a channel 231. I have hockey central and whole@package but that channel is not on my listings
2017-11-01 18:43:12,"Sportsnet 360 says poker, but it’s the game..."

2017-11-01 18:36:46,@Shawhelp It says Pittsburgh vs Oilers on two @Sportsnet channels. No Oilers game. I'm watching baseball and poker. What gives?
2017-11-01 18:34:58,SN360
2017-11-01 18:34:24,I wanna watch the @penguins game and everything is @MLB BS! Hey @Shawhelp what’s going on? I pay for @NHL centre ice too.
2017-11-01 18:33:30,Not ONE of those channels has the hockey game. WTF @NHL and @Shawhelp
2017-11-01 18:32:12,"Three channels showed it listed... SNW, SN1 and SN360 per guide"

2017-11-01 18:07:10,"Well the guide is wrong, particularly the Sportsnet channels"
2017-11-01 18:03:16,"@Shawhelp I know you have the website but I don't even know where to start with all the errors on my guide, particularly Sportsnet"

2017-10-31 22:19:48,"Kinda too late, as long as we don't get bumped again tomorrow. But might i suggest not cold calling people you've bumped to sell tv?"

2017-10-31 11:51:43,@Shawhelp is there a problem with the internet in the calgary area getting really high latency and unstable latency when I was gaming today
2017-10-31 11:19:12,Do any of my Twitter peeps in #YMM have @Shawhelp 150 internet & what's the service like? Looking at switching from @TELUSsupport soon.
2017-10-31 11:07:08,Nope. Still the same after unplug. It’s only the Disney channel too from what I’ve seen.
2017-10-31 11:04:18,I miss the Christmas trees with the lights and the music too. The log fireplace is good but the crackling isn’t.
2017-10-31 11:00:29,it was the main West End location in Edmonton 104 ave and 178 Street.
2017-10-31 10:59:04,"Like it plays a bit of audio for two seconds and then the moment the picture loads, the sound disappears."
2017-10-31 10:58:02,"Every time I go back to it, it switches back to descriptive which is weird."
2017-10-31 10:55:56,So it turns the audio back on when I change it to English but I have to do it every time I flip to the channel? It was fine a few days ago
2017-10-31 10:49:29,Hi Lance! We have another box. It says ARRIS on it.
2017-10-31 10:32:24,@Shawhelp our Disney channel has no sound. It has been days?!?

2017-10-30 21:18:46,but I honestly think you'd have less frustrated customers if you communicated better that there are 2 options available to watch OOM games.
2017-10-30 21:15:43,because I realize that the NHL & Rogers/Sportsnet ultimately are the ones to blame about the separation of the 2 services.
2017-10-30 21:13:22,"I believe it would benefit your customers, & CSR's, if Shaw advertised that there are 2 options. One online only, One cable box only."

2017-10-30 20:52:22,"Don't mean to sound rude, but you didn't answer my question. I'm aware you're telling me I can only watch via the cable box, I'm asking why."
2017-10-30 20:45:18,"Why not? I'm paying over $200 to not be deal w/ regional blackouts, whether I'm watching via cable box or online shouldn't make a difference"
2017-10-30 20:39:43,"I live in Calgary, game is on SNP, but I recently purchased NHL Centre Ice to avoid these regional blackouts. Why can't I watch the game?"

2017-10-29 08:04:20,Morning!! Any help on how to open our Blue Sky remote to change the batteries?? Nothing feels natural and I don't want to force it open
2017-10-29 08:04:05,Pretty sure you work at a media hub and could multitask that one
2017-10-29 08:03:28,@Shawhelp Speedtest shows all is good but my iPhone is having trouble. Seems slow loading twitter page or Facebook page. Something isn’t rt
2017-10-29 08:01:59,@Shawhelp wifi in my house is wonky. Keeps switching from 2.4g to 5g connections. I’ve unplugged everything and started over but same issue
2017-10-29 02:09:50,@Shawhelp is there an issue in the Rocky Mountain House Area in Alberta?

2017-10-28 22:18:55,I made sure it worked . My ppv is working. It cost me $60 to find that out
2017-10-28 22:17:50,So tech wouldn't help. So I just spent $60 on a ppv I didn't want just to make sure I could have people over next week for ufc217
2017-10-28 22:16:04,UFC 216 played for 5 seconds. 1 tech told me to call when a another Ppv was on and they would activate it to ensure it was working.
2017-10-28 21:11:54,@Shawhelp any further updates?
2017-10-28 20:23:16,@Shawhelp Fisher Cres no cable or internet either.

2017-10-25 21:20:04,Hi all! Just got home and the remote for my Blue Sky didn't want to work. Lotsa juice so shut down main unit. Took 15 minutes to reboot!

2017-10-25 20:34:37,I'll try that I forgot about that sorry
2017-10-25 20:31:38,Yes I have had to turn off the Wi-Fi on my phone the connection seems to be very unstable
2017-10-25 20:29:34,My tablet doesn't seem to be connecting as it tells me no internet connection
2017-10-25 20:27:12,"@Shawhelp ,I'm having trouble with my Wi-Fi don't know why"
2017-10-25 20:26:01,@Shawhelp I'm having real problems with my Wi-Fi help
2017-10-25 19:20:28,Hey @CRTCeng @CCTS_CPRST at what point does @Shawhelp need to make a third-party-provided internet outage a priority? Is 21 days enough?
2017-10-25 19:19:11,"Wired speeds ARE low, as I’ve said several times. Around 46 mbps. About the same as the wireless speeds."
2017-10-25 19:16:08,Thanks for your help. Have a good night!
2017-10-25 19:15:49,"I have to put my kids to bed. The internet is still quite useable, so we’ll come back to this later."
2017-10-25 19:14:40,I don’t think that’s the problem. Wired speeds aren’t that much faster than wireless. Thanks though.
2017-10-25 19:13:30,"Alas, that’s not the case. Wired speeds are only slightly faster at 47.65 mbps."
2017-10-25 19:12:08,"Ah, I see. Good point. Connection speed looks around the same for both."
2017-10-25 19:10:30,"Over wifi. Haven’t tried a wired connection lately. But most of our internet devices are wifi, so that’s what I care about most."
2017-10-25 19:09:16,Is it because of location? Are you not able to provide as fast service in rural locations like Vegreville?
2017-10-25 19:08:27,No. Still around 43 mbps.
2017-10-25 19:06:18,Yes. Did you just reset the modem? The modem appears to have reset itself.
2017-10-25 19:02:54,It’s better - up to about 46 mbps. Still nowhere near 75 mbps though.
2017-10-25 19:00:33,Thanks. Would the Shaw Cable signal have cut out when I unplugged the modem?
2017-10-25 18:58:21,Just unplugged for about 45 seconds & plugged back in. Let’s see what happens.
2017-10-25 18:56:57,Thank you!
2017-10-25 18:54:42,I will try in a bit. I recently upgraded from internet 30 to internet 75. Maybe something wasn’t changed over correctly?
2017-10-25 18:52:55,"Just tested a wired connection. Slightly faster, but not by much. 42.32 mbps."
2017-10-25 18:46:32,@Shawhelp I’m currently paying for 75 mbps of internet service. Why am I getting less than 30? pic.twitter.com/f5hEuaoUbm
2017-10-25 18:26:38,It worked. Sorry I bothered you!
2017-10-25 18:24:47,Turned off the modem. It’s coming back now. Give me a minute. I’ll let you know if it worked!

2017-10-22 14:19:47,Well then Shaw has had a lot of free advertising today. I found out that you guys were offering it from this site last week.
2017-10-22 14:17:31,"No, you can actually watch Redzone on Buffstream. Clear as day and no tech issues. I sent my complaint to the NFL to ditch DAZN"

2017-10-22 14:10:52,It’s like shooting fish in a barrel to get people on this site. I switched last week. Now get Redzone. Here’s how DAZN treats customers pic.twitter.com/VTI6f7vw5C

2017-10-20 20:47:15,This isn't the first time my PVR decides not to record something last minute.
2017-10-20 20:46:44,Thankfully I have @Shawhelp . Been enjoying football like I always have the last 3 weeks. @TELUS is letting their customers down.
2017-10-20 20:41:39,I checked the FREEDOM MOBILE APP - it shows 2GB SINCE OCT 13. My plan is about 10-12GB PER MONTH!? Let’s see what happens. @AppleSupport pic.twitter.com/lzDbTKNPO1
2017-10-20 20:40:37,It has nothing to do with changes. I hit record 3hrs earlier. It showed it will record. It doesn't. Not the first time its happened.
2017-10-20 20:31:26,@Shawhelp ...why WHY does the gateway app let me record channels I don't get....
2017-10-20 20:26:36,@Shawhelp Your equipment sucks! I set up a recording of Longtime Running and the PVR decides to not record it! Now I have to wait 5 days!
2017-10-20 20:11:51,Success. It would be nice to be able to paste the 20+ character password into TSNgo - IT guys could fix that so it is 'allowed'. Jus' sayin'
2017-10-20 20:03:07,". @Shawhelp your ""check availability"" tool on your site auto-completes my address, then fails to verify the address it auto-completed itself."

2017-10-18 22:47:28,"@Shawhelp , Is there a list of which games will be blocked by @TSN_Sports ? I’m serious about cancelling TSN 2-5."
2017-10-18 22:18:48,Why is BC in that region? Can't go to either game.
2017-10-18 21:51:45,@TSN_Sports @Shawhelp Why is a #LAKings and #Canadiens game blocked on TSN2 in BC? Time to cancel channels? #stupid
2017-10-18 21:44:11,@Shawhelp This isn't on my TV guide yet... what CTV channel is it & when is it on in #Calgary ? #RIPGordonDownie pic.twitter.com/4vmNhxAOaT
2017-10-18 21:16:29,"If the MAC is added, and the watch attempts to connect to the known network (cause the iPhone does), then the network should allow it."
2017-10-18 21:14:54,"If I’ve added the MAC manually, that’s the authentication step. So why force a second authentication?"
2017-10-18 21:13:09,Answer my question. What’s the point of adding it manually? When you log on you can just save it then. Adding it manually is a useless step.
2017-10-18 21:01:02,Thanks @Shawhelp for the #NBA league pass again this year ! This is my favourite shaw benefit ! #shawtv #NBALeaguePass
2017-10-18 20:49:37,Dry clothes would be wonderful tonight.... That miserable storm we had here on the Coast had left me looking like a drowned rat...

2017-10-18 20:45:45,Ok thanks for looking into it. I’ll check again tomorrow and Friday morning. Don’t want to miss it.
2017-10-18 20:41:45,Question guys. Storm means I don't go home tonight. Is there any way I can tell my Blue Sky PVR to record Nova tonight?
2017-10-18 20:40:10,@Shawhelp i keep getting the error message XRE-030506 on shaw sports channels.
2017-10-18 20:18:28,"Sure, so what’s the point of logging in and adding the MAC manually????"
2017-10-18 20:13:45,Awesome. Thank you! I imagine that’s it. I think it was just announced today.
2017-10-18 20:09:46,Long Time Running the new Tragically Hip documentary. Supposed to air on CTV this Friday I believe at 8pm.

2017-10-13 16:12:23,Thx 4 info. @Shawhelp what incentives are there for an NFL fan wishing to switch from a provider not offering Sunday Ticket to one who does?
2017-10-13 16:06:39,"Yeah getting tired of the runaround. I have sports and time shift, what I don't have is what their competition does have."

2017-10-12 18:50:53,@Shawhelp should have just walked away from your services even tho we are long time customers. Hard to stay positive about your company
2017-10-12 18:50:07,@Shawhelp company. Even setting up the move and schedule a technician to come in took 4 plus phone calls due to screw ups on your end.

2017-10-12 14:54:41,"Drops at same time everyday - 6pm, 9pm, 12am. Seems like wifi dropping at peak times has less to do with modem and more with bad service"
2017-10-12 14:53:36,@Shawhelp silly question does the hd cable box able to record 2 channels at once?
2017-10-12 14:48:54,"Wifi drops 3x a day, there's like 20 folks w/ Shaw on this street, put another node out here so we stop paying for something that won't work"

2017-10-12 11:22:05,"@Shawhelp Do you have plans to expand to Regina, Saskatchewan? If so, when?"
2017-10-12 11:18:53,I know...having it available out west and not having it is torture. @TELUS needs to step up for their customers
2017-10-12 11:17:07,@Shawhelp are the phone lines fixed yet in Saskatoon?

2017-10-10 20:27:44,@Shawhelp Fun trick you have going with the help line just be a loop and never talking to a rep. but I had a question...
2017-10-10 20:24:57,So do I blame @Sportsnet or @Shawhelp for not being able to watch the @Canucks game?
2017-10-10 20:16:23,Switch to TELUS.

2017-10-10 19:40:36,"I do appreciate you streaming this, thank you for that #yycvote"
2017-10-10 19:39:39,"Thanks for quick response. 15 s ad would never start within iOS Twitter browser but did roll, then start webcast from iOS Safari. Frozen now pic.twitter.com/zoLBI3bVHe"

2017-10-10 18:59:35,"@Shawhelp are you currently experiencing outages in Fruitvale, BC area? No WiFi service and have powered modem off a few times."
2017-10-10 18:55:45,@Shawhelp cable isn't working. Got this message. Help! pic.twitter.com/FS5PbAPI4F
2017-10-10 18:54:48,Same here in Glenmore Crowchild Calgary area. Cable and internet down. 2nd time in 2 weeks
2017-10-10 18:40:49,"@Shawhelp I'm super frustrated with Shaw service, more specifically,lack there of right now. Day 2 of no wifi at home and I'm not impressed!"
2017-10-10 18:35:47,So it's still listed as PPV even if you have Sportsnet One? It is a little confusing
2017-10-10 18:27:54,yeah. thanks
2017-10-10 18:24:00,I wasn’t sure if that was a retail location.
2017-10-10 18:18:46,@Shawhelp I’m looking to trade in a remote that isn’t working. Do you know if i can do that at the west edmonton building? (10450 178 St NW)
2017-10-10 18:10:01,I think @Shawhelp needs to update their guide. The DBacks are done like dinna! #NoGame4Necessary pic.twitter.com/oMQ499VeQx
2017-10-10 18:03:02,I only have the 1!
2017-10-10 18:00:48,Same outlet
2017-10-10 17:52:17,@Shawhelp is NHL centre ice still available? If so cost?
2017-10-10 17:50:42,"@Shawhelp internet down again, and cable spotty. third time in the last month, getting pretty frustrated with this!"
2017-10-10 17:41:51,I could use some help....I can't figure out if the world is round or flat? What's the real answer so I can set the record straight
2017-10-10 16:51:54,I think we figured it out - unplugged power bar for router. Thank you for your speedy reply though! Appreciate it : )
2017-10-10 16:46:49,Is the internet and cable down in Airdrie? Or just me?
2017-10-10 16:43:41,@Shawhelp sitting on hold for 45 minutes is the definition of poor customer service.
2017-10-10 16:34:54,No response from Telus yet. I'll wait for a bit longer then start the DM process.
2017-10-10 15:43:40,You're welcome!!!!!
2017-10-10 15:40:17,God bless Lance. You get one free ticket to the gloryhole.
2017-10-10 15:23:53,@Shawhelp are any channels showing Peru vs Colombia? Even PPV?
2017-10-10 14:07:58,"Lol didn't want to reply to me eh? Because I called you guys out on your nonsense. Okay. BTW, internet cutting out all day today. Good job. pic.twitter.com/rqITeKKzVC"
2017-10-10 13:57:54,@Shawhelp how can i find out what time my install was supposed to be i thought it was 11am-1pm but it is now 1pm so i may be wrong
2017-10-10 13:46:46,"@Shawhelp apparently calling customer service is useless. No help, just blame."
2017-10-10 13:30:42,I don't have time for troubleshooting. But this an ongoing issue. I'll have to muddle thru unhappily today and deal with it another day.
2017-10-10 13:13:22,"@Shawhelp I've had to unplug and plug my modem now THREE times today (once more than usual haha sob). What's going on, Shaw?"
2017-10-10 13:09:22,@Shawhelp I'm having lots of internet interruptions today. I'm downtown. Are there issues?
2017-10-10 12:50:57,the shawmail appears to be working but I can't send an attachment...I can't send email from my mobile
2017-10-10 12:44:39,It has been happening since sat so i dont thubk logging in and out would help. It's fine now though
2017-10-10 12:44:23,I'll have a look.. Thank you
2017-10-10 12:26:06,Nope. It was fine last week. Just lately.
2017-10-10 12:18:47,@Shawhelp why does freerange keep on freezing lately?
2017-10-10 11:48:51,"Ok thanks, ya I see it scheduled on 302. That’s good. It would have been very very bad otherwise."
2017-10-10 11:40:30,That's what I thought but @Shawhelp said it was in the Pay Per View 302 but you don't have to pay for it. Right @shaw ?
2017-10-10 11:30:47,HI there.. Is the Shaw Web mail server down...I'm unable to send emails
2017-10-10 11:25:23,@Shawhelp is there an issue with the internet in Sherwood Park?

2017-10-10 11:16:51,@Shawhelp is there anything down in the Vernon BC area? My wifi isn't working / being really slow; and I've tried rebooting it twice :/
2017-10-10 10:38:42,Outages in Sherwood Park? Shaw needs some super fiber optics. We pay good money for cable. Let's make it worth it. @Shawhelp
2017-10-10 10:32:43,@Shawhelp Maybe skip the endless up-sell while I am waiting on hold for tech support already. Not feeling the need to add more Shaw now.
2017-10-10 10:29:13,"Just using Shaw's (a ""Hitron"")."
2017-10-10 10:26:29,Thanks!

2017-10-10 10:01:40,Hi @Shawhelp . I wonder why there is not Internet service in Signal Hill area?
2017-10-10 09:42:21,It went out about 30 minutes ago.

2017-10-10 08:11:41,"WiFi keeps on disconnecting just on my iPhone, not laptop. I’ve rebooted the router twice. Reboot helps for a day and then disconnects again"

2017-10-09 17:55:16,@Shawhelp Is it possible for you to check my internet connection? There have been dropouts in connectivity the last couple of weeks.

2017-10-08 21:56:23,"And it only seems to happen on scheduled recordings. If I do a manual record, it seems to work fine."
2017-10-08 21:54:09,Seems to have happened every week that show has been on. All the other recordings on other channels have been fine.
2017-10-08 21:47:47,The only series recording I currently have active on Space is Star Trek Discovery.

2017-10-08 16:39:52,@Shawhelp - Last year we could watch Madam Secretary on your demand function. Very annoying to find we can’t do this anymore.....grrr
2017-10-08 16:02:48,Is it pro-rated or still $200 for the season. Not offering it from day 1 is 1 of the dumbest things I've ever seen!

2017-10-08 12:09:39,Did I hear right? Shaw is offering NFL Sunday Ticket again? @Shawhelp
2017-10-08 12:02:10,"Hey, hopefully @Shawhelp can be of more assistance to you! Thanks"
2017-10-08 11:44:28,Fair. Well I'll wait till Friday/Saturday and hopefully there's a solution by then. If not I might be downgrading haha. Thanks.
2017-10-08 11:41:47,Will try unplug
2017-10-08 11:41:37,Yes all channels and all pvr recordings
2017-10-08 11:40:35,It's like a cruel taunt. Now. I'm stuck using the awful DAZN app for another week
2017-10-08 11:40:12,I get that. But seems strange that everyone but blue sky customers can get it. Lol. Especially since I can see the channels on my guide.
2017-10-08 11:35:01,Next weekend? Ouch. Hopefully it's ready by next Sunday. Starting to regret getting blue sky if that's the case...
2017-10-08 11:35:00,@Shawhelp just got new box and now the channels live/ pvr temp freeze then jumps ahead to where it currently is.
2017-10-08 11:34:09,Probably looked something like this pic.twitter.com/qPBguqHJRo
2017-10-08 11:32:23,@Shawhelp hey guys are we able to get nfl Sunday ticket yet for Blue sky customers?
2017-10-08 11:31:45,"@Shawhelp added Treehouse for my 5 yr old. Was told it was HD, it’s not. Why no HD? The ‘other’ company has it in HD..."
2017-10-08 10:38:58,"I understand why you want to go DM. But, I would like to let those also know whom follow me that you have fixed this issue."
2017-10-08 10:31:02,This needs attention. Can't tether from@phines all day. Shouldn't have touched this if there wasn't a solution. Very frustrating.
2017-10-08 10:30:10,Did that. The modem goes to switch and then to house. Still not working. Need this fixed ASAP. We all are tethering from phones. $$$$
2017-10-08 10:14:57,pic.twitter.com/kOMoyl5P8o
2017-10-08 10:04:06,Should I manually unplug?
2017-10-08 10:03:26,It did the recycle and is back to loop or sticking. pic.twitter.com/ehtmS0kIUf
2017-10-08 09:43:29,Almost like it is looping. All connections not receiving signal.
2017-10-08 09:42:42,FYI after 5 mins. pic.twitter.com/CorQmLPlOi
2017-10-08 09:39:52,If I order it today how much is it for the season and will i be able to use it today for the games?
2017-10-08 09:18:06,It's all yours sir.
2017-10-08 09:16:52,From your end or mine? What will that do to all my connections in the house?

2017-10-08 08:03:08,"Wow @Shawhelp ,2 MB/s upload speeds. What an amazing plan! I had thought after pulling power and plugging back in that would improve. Not."
2017-10-08 07:28:52,Called @shawhelp yesterday and they knew nothing of the Sunday Ticket. Asked them to check and said it's back. $129. Thanks @DAZNSucks pic.twitter.com/pAyZsFwMna

2017-10-07 23:10:56,"@Shawhelp ever since switching from Shaw direct to Shaw blue sky nothing but crap. Less Channels, always skips or pauses and pvr loops"

2017-10-07 20:10:29,"@Shawhelp Hi. Are the MLB playoffs blacked out from Shaw Freerange? SNET-P says i've ""flown too far"" Thanks."
2017-10-07 19:59:58,@Shawhelp this is the 3rd game in a row the previous game has bled into the flyers time slot. Could you not put it on another channel?

2017-10-07 19:52:41,So I can no longer watch the early game anymore because of geo location?

2017-10-07 19:42:14,@Shawhelp what's the reason for switching to local Omni stations? I can't watch the game in Punjabi now!
2017-10-07 19:40:55,I have power cycled already. No change. In fact it got worse. Before I at leanest had CBC. Now nothing :/

2017-10-07 11:40:32,@ShawInfo @Shawhelp Good lord 35-35 minute hold time 109 in queue. When will you admit new modems are buggy garbage.
2017-10-07 11:40:07,"I don't know the account number offhand, I didn't set it up, I just work out of this office, but I can find out if needed."
2017-10-07 11:39:10,8312 Fraser Avenue. Business account. It's literally been going on/off for last week solid. They did sewer work around here recently.
2017-10-07 11:34:47,Anyone else enjoying the random @Shawhelp internet dropouts in #ymm ? Pretty frustrating when you're trying to work & it keeps going off.
2017-10-07 11:30:07,No Redzone?
2017-10-07 11:10:23,@Shawhelp updates when blue sky customers can get Sunday ticket?
2017-10-07 11:10:14,@Shawhelp just actually called up was told blue sky can't add it on right now but regular customers can. Will there be a place to follow
2017-10-07 11:08:16,@Shawhelp You're now getting Sunday ticket. Info?? How much if you already have DAZN?
2017-10-07 10:21:16,"@DAZN_CA SO HAPPY @Shawhelp came through for us Canadians. Yes, no @RedZoneChannel BUT there'll also be a solid feed and no lag."
2017-10-07 10:16:24,@Shawhelp it seems like a larger issue than just me when a sampling of friends have CC #gibberish on higher channels #gatewayfail
2017-10-07 10:13:36,Bell?

2017-10-07 09:46:21,Just called @Shawhelp in BC and they knew nothing.......is this some sort of trick? Please elaborate.
2017-10-07 09:45:22,Make the move to @Shawhelp boys for football season.
2017-10-07 09:32:53,Today's constant stream drops are brought to you by @Shawhelp . Give them four months and nine tech visits and you'll still not have service
2017-10-07 09:30:07,Do I also have to pay @Shawhelp for it or does what I payed for you cover it?
2017-10-07 09:29:24,Okay sounds good. Thanks.

2017-10-07 09:01:09,Will it be like before with clear HD picture? If Dazn is giving you the rights I’m just scared about the quality they will provide cable.

2017-10-06 20:29:17,No they are not. This is Canada.
2017-10-06 20:28:44,Only on MLB because Sportsnet chose not to purchase.
2017-10-06 20:27:39,When did this happen? Is the @nflnetwork finally in HD? @Shawhelp
2017-10-06 20:25:40,It really is. The Astros game yesterday was the same deal. Only on MLB.
2017-10-06 20:24:59,Why? Games are always televised. Annoying AF
2017-10-06 20:24:46,Thanks. It wasn't just me though. Lots of other people involved.
2017-10-06 20:24:32,FreeRange TV has saved me allot of Pain like on hot days watching TV on the Balcony or at Starbucks etc even soaking in the Tub chilling
2017-10-06 20:22:17,You did the heavy lifting though. Thank you so much for taking the lead on this!
2017-10-06 20:21:51,"I mean it, man. This is in large part solely because of your efforts. You ran a relentless, respectful campaign."
2017-10-06 20:19:35,It’s only on MLB network.

2017-10-06 20:15:14,I guess Sportsnet was to cheap to buy the rights to the game from MLB.
2017-10-06 20:12:54,Don't they have like 5 TSN channels?

2017-10-04 21:50:01,@RogersHelps @Shawhelp @sportsnet y can't we fix the jerky hockey games? Every few seconds as players move there is a stutter in the video

2017-09-27 18:03:55,@TELUS What can you guys offer me that @ShawHelp can't? I'm losing my patience with being overcharged for poor and unreliable service.
2017-09-27 18:01:04,@Shawhelp I've heard about outages in Vancouver but I haven't had service since early this morning
2017-09-27 17:33:49,"@Shawhelp in YYC, blue sky cable, not one channel's soundtrack syncing with the actors. Tested on TV speaker and sound bar. What's up??"
2017-09-27 17:16:36,True. Benefit with MTS is multiple service locations so when you need to return defective bit not a 2 hour outing
2017-09-27 17:02:32,They are all a bit blah. We just switched to MTS. Canada needs to seriously improve its tech providers.
2017-09-27 15:45:45,I need some help... I'm on the vegas strip right now and not sure where to go next either @MGMGrand or @NYNYVegas ?

2017-09-27 14:13:46,I just noticed someone I know having issues . Figured my Internet might be down as well. I haven’t checked mine yet
2017-09-27 14:13:15,@TELUS do you have a temporary solution for the #ymm folks? @Shawhelp doesn’t they just have false promises.
2017-09-27 14:09:03,@Shawhelp is there a kamloops outage? https:// twitter.com/kamscan/status /913133061788770304 …
2017-09-27 14:05:47,Just wish your company was honest from the beginning. I’m no longer loyal. The first company to provide the service is who I’m going with
2017-09-27 13:55:28,Big surprise another 2-3 week wait. I suppose this time is for real! Customer service clearly is not a priority for @Shawhelp #tiredoflies
2017-09-27 13:43:30,Thank you for that info.

2017-09-27 11:01:31,@Shawhelp my Internet is down in South Vancouver. Do you have any outages in that area?
2017-09-27 10:58:45,"Actually it started yesterday mid-day, on to day two here. Have internet back this morning, but still no cable :("
2017-09-27 10:50:07,"Any updates for the Agassiz outage? Been without cable since yesterday, and nobody is updating the Outages page on your website :("
2017-09-27 10:20:10,A link to promotions for when you switch service providers? @TELUS

2017-09-27 08:12:44,Methinks you don't understand the problem. It's not his version of Flash. It's the fact that it's Flash in the first place.
2017-09-27 08:08:26,No it went down for about an hour all good now
2017-09-27 01:20:38,. @Shawhelp IM TRYING TO WATCH ANIME TELL ME WHY MY WIFI ISNT WORKING

2017-09-26 22:38:27,ok i turned off wifi on the phone and it works *shrug* you didn't annoy @Shawhelp did you?
2017-09-26 22:26:36,Mm could I get 15up with a smaller down since 150d is overkill for me? Could we work out a symmetrical 15/15 plan or you're not flexible?
2017-09-26 22:19:38,Yes. A very useful feature of Webmail 6.0 was eliminated in Webmail 7.0. Why? How much cost savings achieved vs customer convenience?
2017-09-26 22:05:15,"I'm more concerned with upload speed: your 150plan is only 15up unless I misunderstand? I don't even need 150down, but I want 30+ upload"
2017-09-26 21:53:37,". @Shawhelp : I was going to do Telus because their 150up&down for $50 1 yr plan is good for webdev. But they suck, can u offer similar plan?"
2017-09-26 21:51:28,"Prior to Web 7.0 calendar settings appeared as a thumbnail in the lower right corner of the screen. Now, not. Why eliminate a good feature?"

2017-09-26 17:21:13,At least Telus is a public company and have actual shareholders to report to. Shaw answers ONLY to the Shaw family.
2017-09-26 17:18:03,id burn babies alive before i do anything with Telus they fucked me over so hard when i first got to canada
2017-09-26 17:14:06,"I'm at the point where I'm seriously considering switching to @TELUSsupport , because they can offer me similar service at half the cost."

2017-09-26 17:12:45,"My connection routinely drops out daily, multiple times a day, and it's happening at hardware points OUTSIDE of my residence."
2017-09-26 17:12:10,"I've had issues with latency for ages, and the cheapness continues by routing me through crappy Shaw gateways that can't handle the load."
2017-09-26 17:11:26,A better Tier 1 provider would NOT route traffic through 3 major exchanges that add incredible unnecessary latency.

2017-09-22 21:42:39,I'm just asking for a friend. So I'm not 100% sure. I was just asking generally if there was an outage. I have to go back tomorrow to see it
2017-09-22 21:29:09,"@Shawhelp Dan, one of your tech support associates on Vancouver Island - do whatever you can to keep him. He is an asset to your company."

2017-09-22 20:23:14,@shawhelp why did our TV menu go to 'to be announced' on all channels? No interruption to reception
2017-09-22 20:23:11,"@Shawhelp internet is really spotty here in Sherwood Park. Also, Oilers game says I'm blacked out, but works fine on mobile data. ?"

2017-09-22 19:53:07,@Shawhelp Internet service is being extremely unstable periodically today in Edmonton / Sherwood Park. Connection keeps dropping.
2017-09-22 19:24:47,Fair enough I manage @WickedCup if you ever want a good coffee then
2017-09-22 19:20:22,@Shawhelp if you have had to give up either beer or sodas for the rest of your life what would you pick ? Ps everything here is great
2017-09-22 19:20:10,We pay @Shawhelp $1100 a month as a small business when our internet goes down - no helpline - 30 mins on hold! #garbage

2017-09-22 15:23:09,Actually these are the Canadian ones but I know you guys have the same issues there too! I think ours are worse because of our higher fees!
2017-09-22 15:21:02,Yup In Canada we only have 5 Large Service Providers. We pay some of the highest fees in the World.
2017-09-22 14:57:54,@Shawhelp so how does my modem look right now because I'm about to reboot it due to no internet

2017-09-22 14:09:37,Also remind the CEO of @Shawhelp that SHAW is a http:// HWO.ZONE company. JUDGEMENT TO FOLLOW. Fix the problem. I require full speed!
2017-09-22 14:02:15,with a reconditioned box that doesn't work. End up getting the last new one in his truck anyways. Great Customer Service.
2017-09-22 14:00:56,they are giving Killer Deals to new Customers. Finally our box quits altogether. The service Rep promises us a New Box. Installer comes by >
2017-09-22 13:59:11,If it isn't me resetting the box it is my son! It is ridiculous!
2017-09-22 13:58:02,Ya. With Shaw last time our Cable Box was failing. They had us resetting it for about 6 months. We were customers for 10 years. Meanwhile >>
2017-09-22 13:55:58,I hate playin that stupid game! I just want a good serv that I pay 4! That's it! I've had Shaw in 5 times they leave I'm fine 4 mayB a month
2017-09-22 13:52:51,and free TV's or something. Lol. Same Old Same Old.
2017-09-22 13:52:09,"Well Shaw it's your turn to Suck. Don't worry it will cycle to Telus again eventually, then I'll move to Shaw when you are offering deals>>"
2017-09-22 13:45:27,Same every time U send s/one out prob turn the signal up so I get a good month of service after my complaint then U guys turn my signal down
2017-09-22 13:19:26,Thanks Steph @Shawhelp . If everyone at a help desk was helpful and responsive as you I would never complain about needing tech support.
2017-09-22 12:49:59,"Yes, we saw that but there doesn't seem to be an ETA. ^Ariane"

2017-09-22 11:53:24,Is there an outage in Vancouver? Restarted modem twice.. still nothing.
2017-09-22 11:16:52,@Shawhelp ur shaw open is annoying. I have to constantly turn off wifi to get internet. It ensures I will never switch to shaw.
2017-09-22 10:28:25,Tell your friend to accept nothing less than a free year from Shaw. Terrible
2017-09-22 10:26:25,"It's not me, it's a friend from work. I didn't know this was normal either"
2017-09-22 10:25:32,#Band66SIMs would be a SIM card that contains the Band 66 program that @Shawhelp wrote for you. Think how much $$ you could make!
2017-09-22 10:24:18,How can Shaw cancel your Telus? If they did that I'd lose it too....don't see how that is legal. Accept nothing less than a free year.
2017-09-22 10:22:17,"Shaw went ahead and canceled the telus service. Shaw also said they would have a rep out today, now they say next week"
2017-09-22 10:20:50,Wouldn't that be on the consumer to schedule things accordingly? Blaming the provider is hilarious in its stupidity.
2017-09-22 10:18:22,@Shawhelp a question for you pic.twitter.com/yAVbBOOkBu

2017-09-20 18:15:06,"Its because TSN Jets coverage is local to Manitoba only. But I saw the team say it was on Center Ice, but it says it's blackout restricted"
2017-09-20 18:14:32,"Not for me. For some reason I get TSN 1, 2, 4, & 5. But TSN 3 ""The scheduled program is not available in your region""."
2017-09-20 18:13:36,"Center Ice Channel does show the game, and doesn't give the no subscription thing, but oh well no worries, I found a stream."
2017-09-20 18:12:40,"No I'm in Edmonton, TSN Jets local coverage is blacked out, gotta use Center Ice. Honestly I'm just assuming the free preview for CI is on"
2017-09-20 18:12:39,"When you live in Edmonton, pay an extra $200 for Center Ice and STILL can't get the Oilers game wtf @Shawhelp"
2017-09-20 18:12:33,I am in Edmonton. 183 says blacked out and 238 is not a channel I get. 351 says blacked out too
2017-09-20 18:11:39,"Nope it says blacked out too, only showing in Winnipeg region lol."
2017-09-20 18:11:05,It wont be on tv lol.
2017-09-20 18:10:36,This is fkn brutal. It's a preseason. There is no reason for it to be blacked out. @EdmontonOilers @Shawhelp @NHL
2017-09-20 18:09:41,FIX IT please pretty please
2017-09-20 18:05:43,@Shawhelp The Oilers Jets game was supposed to be on Center ice according to the Oilers but is showing blacked out...?

2017-09-17 20:07:09,Hey Shaw! Unplugging for a minute didn't fix the issue! Descriptive video is still on for some channels.
2017-09-17 20:02:45,@Shawhelp what's going in with he TSN and NBC feed for this Sunday night game? You guys trying to compete with @DAZN_CA with poor signal?

2017-09-17 19:25:13,How did the switch go? This is my fourth day of dropped fixed dropped with Telus. It's getting ridiculous. I have 5 services.

2017-09-17 18:25:11,It'll bounce back up but for some reason my connetion doesn't sustain. Pinging and tracerouting have yet to identify issues (small packets)

2017-09-17 17:03:38,Getting ahold of @Shawhelp on the phone is insane. I wish the tv and internet would work correctly #annoyed
2017-09-17 17:03:01,We switched to @telus 6 months ago and there is NO comparison. Good switch
2017-09-17 16:52:48,As mentioned already we tried that. It made things worse. Time stuck at midnight. Can't scroll or change channels in guide now.
2017-09-17 16:51:26,@Shawhelp . Fix your cable listings! Haven't been working all week. Resetting made it worse. Can't scroll/change channels when in guide now.
2017-09-17 16:47:41,Same issue here for us and it's been over a week. Powering off/resetting made it worse.
2017-09-17 16:33:33,"It's most frustrating when Canadian channels carry same games as US. IE, 49ers on 203 and 210 right now. That's a waste of a channel."
2017-09-17 16:26:07,At one point Rams were on both channels....
2017-09-17 16:19:22,"@Shawhelp Why does the TV guide say ""Cowboys vs Broncos"" on 217, the game I WANT to watch, but it's showing ""Rams vs Redskins""???"

2017-09-17 09:24:09,You guys picked a really bad time to do this maintenance. A lot of people look forward to football Sundays including pre-game shows.
2017-09-17 09:15:54,@Shawhelp i don't see system outage notification. I got VoD errors 16528 and internet is running between 5-10 MBPS
2017-09-17 09:15:02,It says the maintenance was supposed to be over 9 MDT. Is this gonna be fixed before 10AM PST? I need to watch football.
2017-09-17 09:12:27,Any ideas on how to get the channels back on your listings. Tried everything to reprogram?
2017-09-17 09:09:01,@Shawhelp any reports of issues logging into Shaw from TSN's live streams?

2017-09-16 23:09:24,"Wow! Fantastic timing for a scheduled maintenance to VOD! I pay $100's/mo. Why no heads up?! Shame on you, @ShawInfo @Shawhelp !"
2017-09-16 23:06:26,@Shawhelp Here's the thing. If you're going to compete with Netflix one needs to be able to actually sign into the app.

2017-09-08 19:07:12,I did try last night but not today. I didn't want to try anything else and lose the football game last night! I'll try again now.
2017-09-08 19:06:19,When I channel up past NBC the channel #skips back to NBC but shows what is on Fox. Then I hit channel up again and it puts Fox w correct #
2017-09-08 19:04:23,"NBC and CBC are giving the same error today. Last night NBC worked, TSN didn't, and I don't know about CBC. I only have one tv."
2017-09-08 19:02:58,@Shawhelp Hi. Can U tell me re Shaw TV bundles: Is the Large Ent 2 theme pack considered 1 option or 3 separate bundle when getting TV 7 pks
2017-09-08 18:58:44,@Shawhelp is there a reason that TSN hasn't worked on my tv the last two days? Signal loss detected. Most channels work by a few don't.

2017-09-08 08:34:47,It's not that the hotspots don't work. It's just the continual attempting to connect and then losing the connection when I've walked past
2017-09-08 08:34:05,Yes. If I stay in one spot I'll connect. It seems like by the time my phone connects I've walked past the hotspot

2017-09-07 20:16:53,Then when you complain they use the only defence and that is read your user agreement
2017-09-07 20:15:54,Telus maybe be cheaper at the beginning and they Promise the Sun and Deliver Nothing
2017-09-07 20:14:49,@Shawhelp why does my new 5G internet keep cutting out?

2017-09-07 18:26:48,@Shawhelp I noticed that the Shaw-Go-Wifi is really slow. I had to turn off my wifi to end my parking session. I was in the beltline.
2017-09-07 18:16:07,Is there a list of everything I should have when bringing back devices like this?
2017-09-07 17:59:31,"Thanks for responding, if you can provide feedback upstream, it is laughable that you're marketing a servive that you can't provide specs on"
2017-09-07 17:51:40,@Shawhelp If I'm going to connect a wireless router to my modem do I need to change any settings in it?
2017-09-07 17:49:43,It says 80+ channels. So someone made a list and counted at some point.
2017-09-07 17:48:57,So when I'm shopping for cable tv packages there is no way to know of which channels will be available on the go? Ads suggest it's not all
2017-09-07 17:42:29,@Shawhelp I'm looking to find a list that shows what cable tv channels are also available on #freerangetv
2017-09-07 17:42:24,@Shawhelp any network issues atm? My receiver has rebooted on it's own twice in last 10 min

2017-09-07 17:12:12,@Shawhelp I just wanted to let you guys know I'm very happy with my service. The person I dealt with on the phone last week was great.
2017-09-07 17:03:18,"2 hrs and 14 min on hold, just to get a ""sorry"" message and then the call disconnects. Not happy. @ShawInfo @Shawhelp #wastemytime"
2017-09-07 16:45:40,That's right. I found that was much less painless on campus than the other options. Will the team be back at UBC tomorrow?

2017-09-06 12:55:02,I obviously have to type this here cause the non-emergency #is slower than @Shawhelp Internet 30
2017-09-06 12:12:50,@Shawhelp if I have Internet 150 is it truly Unlimited now? Still showing 1024GB in the account
2017-09-06 12:10:43,We have actually been without internet since yesterday around 1pm. Is there an ETA on a fix? This is almost 24 hours now
2017-09-06 12:03:52,. @Shawhelp still waiting.....WTF my time is worth more than the monthly cost of your services. pic.twitter.com/mnLTt6ZgLt
2017-09-06 11:45:20,yes and now it's also saying something about signal loss being detected?
2017-09-06 11:33:16,@Shawhelp hey! What's going on in the belt line in YYC? BIG outage!
2017-09-06 10:59:32,Reported to Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre. I’d rather knock them off network (this number at least) to protect others @Shawhelp @CanRevAgency pic.twitter.com/8bKCrYZiUV
2017-09-06 10:34:58,@Shawhelp When do you expect internet in the Beltline in Calgary to be back up?
2017-09-06 10:31:04,But that’s the same number they give me to call back. Maybe that number doesn’t reach them and is a red herring. http:// findwhocallsyou.com/page/2
2017-09-06 10:29:43,Thank you for the quick reply
2017-09-06 10:29:43,Anyone else experiencing the slowest internet connection with @Shawhelp today?
2017-09-06 10:23:54,The internet is still not working. Is there an outage? SW Calgary.
2017-09-06 10:23:42,Likely a fake number from caller ID spoofing.

2017-09-02 12:32:25,I don't know. They told me they weren't able to get me an appt until next Sunday. They gave me a credit but it doesn't make up for the time
2017-09-02 12:25:37,Totally obvious the tech skipped our appointment so they could get off early. I'm livid.
2017-09-02 12:24:57,"Yup! Tech was supposed to come this morning. Didn't ring the bell or call. Just left a ""sorry we missed you"" card"

2017-08-31 19:33:07,"Yep but shouldn't have to.-doesn't address the fundamental issue-happens daily at the same time. Doing nothing, will work in 15 minutes."
2017-08-31 19:27:45,Done that. I shouldn't have to do this daily! Which has been the case since we upgraded... not impressed. Thought the bugs had been sorted

2017-08-29 19:09:54,@Shawhelp getting very high ping on tracert. Any network shenanigans in the Greater Vancouver Area today?
2017-08-29 19:07:34,I'm not to sure about that. I should have asked if there was a network problem first.
2017-08-29 18:36:00,@Shawhelp Is it possible to suspend cable service for a period of time while still using internet?
2017-08-29 18:34:10,Its working now

2017-08-29 17:54:15,@Shawhelp How much will NHL Centre Ice and NBA League Pass be this season?
2017-08-29 17:51:01,@Shawhelp any reason why our internet would keep cutting in and out?
2017-08-29 17:25:53,Thank You. It might be a router issue. Seems to be working again.
2017-08-29 17:21:53,"@Shawhelp are you having issues in Victoria? Internet went down about 15 minutes ago. Rebooted everything, still nothing."
2017-08-29 16:30:03,@Shawhelp Is the Wifi Network down in Fleetwood?! There seems to be interference.

2017-08-29 15:46:12,58 min to disconnect my @Shawhelp shaw service... only took 28 min to set up a brand new @TELUS tv and internet service... #51minhold

2017-08-29 15:19:43,Yes and I keep getting told my call is important to you
2017-08-29 15:09:13,@Shawhelp why is it that when I want a new service my call is answered in 2 mins & when I want to disconnect I'm on hold for 1h & counting??
2017-08-29 14:54:26,hopefully he is now getting the assistance/support that he needs (and more than a little frustrating for a costumer switching service...)

2017-08-28 00:26:11,I started to create one but it said that would deactivate the main Shaw login so I did not activate. I usually authenticate with a Shaw 1/2

2017-08-27 17:48:37,"My attempt @calming the madness. Boggles my mind this is the 'best' or ""only"" solution Thanks anyway!"
2017-08-27 17:24:44,@Shawhelp is there any way you can get the @yestvcanada because Shaw does not have enough Retro stations and Dejaview is a joke
2017-08-27 17:07:27,I don't think it's a manual recording. Didn't know I could set a manual recording. I've set the recording for that event. Name is wrong.
2017-08-27 17:01:47,"If the guide gets updated, it'll affect recordings, yes?"

2017-08-26 21:07:28,We actually finally got through on the phone and it's fixed now. Thanks!
2017-08-26 21:06:30,@Shawhelp 2 hours later and I finally get to watch the fight. $100 well spent......
2017-08-26 21:03:44,Thanks we unplugged and reset both the main gateway and the portal and that worked.
2017-08-26 20:59:23,All good - thanks for the follow up!
2017-08-26 20:56:41,@Shawhelp why isn't the fight working between mayweather&mccgregor in Winnipeg?!
2017-08-26 20:55:00,When we try to tune to 300 it pops up the menu with the 'watch' option but clicking that just takes us to a black screen.
2017-08-26 20:52:06,Figured it out. The purchase didn't go through on your end apparently according to the phone support person. Thanks.
2017-08-26 20:50:34,@Shawhelp please help me !! I've ordered the PPV and still have no signal almost 2 hours in !!!!
2017-08-26 20:47:09,Thanks - but I'm pretty sure the issue is with @UFC .

2017-08-26 19:57:43,"Done a reboot, ordered on both HD and SD channel and still nothing?"
2017-08-26 19:57:21,@Shawhelp I presume we will not be charged for the PPV fight we ordered & cant watch? Where is the support st $99/ purchase?
2017-08-26 19:57:19,@Shawhelp hey - can't seem to purchase the fight? Tried unplugging it the box. No go. Help!
2017-08-26 19:56:42,Maybe god is telling you the jets are not worth watching

2017-08-26 19:50:06,All other channels and recording are working properly. Please help
2017-08-26 19:49:33,We bought the fight tonight. Channel 300 just has a black screen and our recording only has the copy right warning. Can you help us?
2017-08-26 19:48:55,Same things happening for me. Any luck fixing it?
2017-08-26 19:47:40,"Try unplugging shaw box for 30 seconds. After reboot it worked for us. We had to ""buy"" again. Hopefully we havent paid twice but..its workin"
2017-08-26 19:46:19,@Shawhelp ordered the fight in English and only French is showing up. Lot of angry dudes here! Been on hold for an hour already.
2017-08-26 19:46:04,"No feed here. Paid for PPV, no support (on hold on phone). Glad we invited ppl over for the fight. Will be cancelling shaw tomorrow"
2017-08-26 19:45:44,We unplugged shaw box for 30 seconds...took a while to reboot. Its working now. Worth a try?
2017-08-26 19:44:48,"@Shawhelp PPV not working, on hold for 30 minutes. If I miss Mayweather fight switching to @TELUSsupport"
2017-08-26 19:44:13,"It's all good now, it took a while but it finally started to work. Thanks!"
2017-08-26 19:43:15,"Unplugged 30 seconds. We went back to 300 at 7:37pm and had to ""rebuy"" the PPV. Now working. I hope we didn't pay for this twice."

2017-08-26 19:05:59,Same here
2017-08-26 19:04:49,"@Shawhelp are there any issues with the fight, I ordered it but it froze at 1 second in the countdown."
2017-08-26 19:04:14,Still seems to be happening. It's happening on BBC news and pbs Detroit wtvs. Picture seems to have no issues but sound gets choppy
2017-08-26 19:04:04,Now I have a screen that shows the boxers and it says Coming Up Next
2017-08-26 19:03:40,"@DAZN_CA is horrible, I've practically thrown in the towel for NFL Sunday's this year."
2017-08-26 19:03:34,@Shawhelp hi! We've been on hold for over an hour to order the fight on pay per view. Why the long wait? #thanks !
2017-08-26 19:02:23,It's 7:02 - just have a black screen
2017-08-26 18:53:14,@Shawhelp I can't see channel 300 to order the fight.
2017-08-26 18:45:07,@shawhelp getting audio issues on non hd channels right now in Burnaby. Any reported issues?
2017-08-26 18:13:49,So @DAZN_CA appears to be 60-90 seconds behind the live feed of the Browns game. This is a major issue for fantasy football.
2017-08-26 18:05:50,Ok..
2017-08-26 17:34:44,what? Been HD for yrs Jake switch man Telus Optic HD no issues even Sunday Ticket just sayin
2017-08-26 17:27:36,@Shawhelp Has there been any Internet issues in Prince George or is it just me ? Rebooting routers not fixing it- no net or phone.
2017-08-26 17:24:32,@Shawhelp Awesome!!! More cell phone overages thanks to no wifi. #EatShitChoppyWifi pic.twitter.com/CITPHTrFuB
2017-08-26 17:16:07,"No offense, but that's just stupid. It should be a feature that is unlocked w/ the subscription. (You can have that idea. Now run w/ it. )"
2017-08-26 16:43:50,"Speaking of which, how come my @WWENetwork doesn't have the OnDemand option? Shaw jipped me of the free mon. Gonna jip me of OnDemand, too?"
2017-08-26 16:42:48,@RBC @Shawhelp @Titleist @PUMAGolf @scoreband I will reconsider the sponsors backing you. To slam new fans you get $ to attract #bearealpro
2017-08-26 16:39:49,Not the end of the world. Just sucks that it's not included in the On Demand.
2017-08-26 16:39:36,@Shawhelp my Shaw box froze up randomly and now just says no IP. I've rebooted four or five times now. What else can I do?
2017-08-26 15:46:07,Not sure you want it right now
2017-08-26 15:40:24,Not going to pay money to support a racist and a woman-beater fighting for $130 million. Overpaid wastes of skin.
2017-08-26 15:36:20,@Shawhelp hi! Can I cancel my service by going to a Shaw Kiosk (say Oakridge mall)?
2017-08-26 15:31:11,"Have to DM ya later. While new PVR is dropping programs, life must go on."
2017-08-26 15:27:42,I collide the same way for a non existent parking spot
2017-08-26 15:23:23,Gets my downvote!
2017-08-26 15:09:23,"@Shawhelp However, the ""new"" (refurbished) PVR has already omitted one of my programmed recordings. Does all of your equipment suck?!"
2017-08-26 15:08:18,"@Shawhelp I got the new (refurbished) PVR y'all sent me. Like it, though it's taking some getting used to."
2017-08-26 14:48:19,You guys ready for the Maywather V McGregor fight?

2017-08-25 23:23:21,Hi. I ended up talking to your tech support on the phone and I guess I can't be helped right now because of your system maintenance
2017-08-25 22:42:09,@Shawhelp I was messaging with you last night and now have another issues - can I just send another DM? Thanks
2017-08-25 22:34:39,@Shawhelp Is there an internet outage for the Bridgeland/ Renfrew area in Calgary?

2017-08-25 21:36:58,"@Shawhelp Hey my internet is being super extra slow tonight, are there any service hiccups in burnaby?"

2017-08-25 21:08:47,I always get your notifications
2017-08-25 21:08:10,I don't know if @youtube hates me or @shawhelp internet Is just TRASH. Notifs never work.
2017-08-25 21:08:04,I want to thank @Shawhelp for their assistance in getting my BFF's cable sorted out. She is very happy to have her favourite channels back.
2017-08-25 21:03:53,Thanks for the reply. Apple TV it is then! Thanks!
2017-08-25 20:53:01,@Shawhelp looking for some help ordering the fight for tomorrow night. We have internet with you but not TV. Still possible?
2017-08-25 20:03:16,Lost service too. Must be an outage?
2017-08-25 20:00:32,@Shawhelp hey there! Our tv and internet just stopped working in wood buffalo neighbourhood in Fort mcmurray - planned outage?
2017-08-25 19:42:12,Yes and it sounds like they just believe that I gave my password to my modem to someone. Going dm... ok
2017-08-25 19:39:51,I have talked to them. I just want to know if it's possible that they have made a mistake.
2017-08-25 19:38:52,Is it possible there system has made a mistake. Because I live alone & it's impossible. Even watching movies 24 hours would only be 72 GB
2017-08-25 19:37:25,Its a telus acct but I may soon part company with them if I can't resolve it.
2017-08-25 19:36:11,@Shawhelp I am sick to my stomach. When I checked usage today shows more than 300 gb used in one day. Its impossible. 1/2
2017-08-25 19:19:00,I will give this a try
2017-08-25 19:17:57,It does seem to be hd channels.

2017-08-25 14:37:50,@Shawhelp hey guys. Curious if you've received my payment yet? I posted it late Wednesday from OLB.
2017-08-25 14:03:51,Do you know who is? It seems impossible to find any good details on this event for Canada. @ufc @Bell @Shawhelp
2017-08-25 13:57:44,thank you :) frustration might be forcing our hand in the fall!
2017-08-25 13:43:00,"Honestly, this is not very good customer service."
2017-08-25 13:39:33,Can you tell them to hurry up at answer my phone call? It is almost an hour now.
2017-08-25 13:30:03,"@Shawhelp It is coming up on 50 minutes now, this is ridiculous."
2017-08-25 13:16:52,It is almost 35 minutes now
2017-08-25 13:16:49,@Shawhelp my phone support agent was amazing. I didn't get her name. If I DM deets can you ck my file and send commendation to her manager?
2017-08-25 13:08:29,"@Shawhelp I have been on hold for over 25 minutes now, are that many people really trying to cancel your services right now?"

2017-08-25 11:07:31,"Thank you for letting me know, hopefully it is up and running soon."
2017-08-25 10:53:28,"@Shawhelp do you have any outages reported for Calgary, all of the sudden the modem cannot get online."
2017-08-25 10:40:25,"Trust me, if you guys had service in the area you would have tons of clients. I've already spoken with Business services about it. Thanks."

2017-08-25 09:40:12,"Thankfully since the box talks, it'll announce if descriptive video available and I'll just selected for each time I want to watch it."
2017-08-25 09:32:26,Will that do any good if my city is in the heat of the outage map?
2017-08-25 09:24:04,@Shawhelp you guys are bullshit we don't pay you hundreds for wifi that only works sometimes fix that shit fr
2017-08-25 09:20:58,"Correct, but it shouldn't turn off recorded commentary of a sports event"
2017-08-25 09:15:58,"Would get the Odd commercial audio, then game no commentary. Thought golf channel was down."
2017-08-25 09:13:56,I thought the golf channel wasn't working. I was getting descriptive video on other channels
2017-08-25 09:12:46,That wouldn't work as I couldn't read it anyways
2017-08-25 09:08:07,Ug this sucks. Tryong to turn on video description but it turns sap on causing commentary to go away on the golf channel @Shawhelp
2017-08-25 08:44:43,Done :). Thank you
2017-08-25 08:40:05,Did that last night. Was working this morning and went out again at 6:45. I've left home now. Will try resetting again tonight.

2017-08-22 07:47:13,@Shawhelp good Morning pic.twitter.com/0vkSB6m3de
2017-08-21 23:36:51,All happens during midnight (after your working hour)...
2017-08-21 23:36:28,We have experienced multiple times of internet interruption for more than 30 mins in the past three months...
2017-08-21 23:20:38,That fixed it :) Thanks Ken.
2017-08-21 22:23:06,Hi! My connectivity issues have resolved now. Thanks for the reply!
2017-08-21 22:18:13,@Shawhelp pic.twitter.com/PdnoFfwHNi
2017-08-21 22:08:59,It's all a scam but mark my words a year from now every one will be back to cable with some streaming as downloads will become 2 expensive
2017-08-21 22:07:07,U realize it's all 1 pipeline right ??? They all share it Shaw owns it ... mts owns a few channels Shaw rents but 4 most part all rent shaw
2017-08-21 22:06:09,@Shawhelp Hi! I have WiFi access on my phone but I'm unable to connect on my laptop. Can you help?
2017-08-21 22:04:22,Thanks!
2017-08-21 22:04:06,True although I've found them to be slow lately.
2017-08-21 22:03:44,I phoned two weeks ago. Thanks though!!!
2017-08-21 22:00:37,"My dad has MTS-TV. IMO, Shaw is far superior."
2017-08-21 21:56:59,They used telus towers til a week ago but change only affects bell clients mts zip changed for the record but they can spin it for media
2017-08-21 21:56:22,Should I trust them? Is this a new promotion?
2017-08-21 21:56:02,Shaw Go Wifi is excellent. Lots of hot spots.
2017-08-21 21:54:31,The reason I left MTS was awful wifi in my area. Apparently they improved their network here since.
2017-08-21 21:52:58,Mts sux u will regreat it
2017-08-21 21:51:09,MTS sent me a letter offering an amazing deal. Im seriously thinking about leaving @Shawhelp for the first time in years.
2017-08-21 21:47:41,@Shawhelp I got a call from 855 274 7429. Is this a legit Shaw number? They are offering to increase my internet speed without extra charge.
2017-08-21 21:47:36,I did. Got tired after 45mins of being on hold @ShawDirect . Looking forward to pro-rated bill credit.
2017-08-21 21:37:26,@Shawhelp Direct has been down for 24 hours now. On hold for 40 mins. Solution soon?
2017-08-21 21:06:08,What is Bell doing doing to get Sunday ticket? @TELUSsupport
2017-08-21 20:49:45,I bet @Shawhelp will have gigabit out before you get Infinet activated. Even when it's already wired.
2017-08-21 20:32:03,thanks :( hopefully will be back! @Shawhelp whats with the internet!?
2017-08-21 20:21:55,HBO is available in Canada with Shaw. Just ask @Shawhelp they will hook you up!
2017-08-21 19:19:20,I have huge issues with Telus. Stuff is always going wrong. Wish I had Shaw again
2017-08-21 19:04:51,"Hi Ken. Freerange works with Edge. Using Chrome, Flash works on other sites but not Freerange. My Mac won't run Freerange/Chrome either."
2017-08-21 18:56:40,Telus was amazing to us in Alberta
2017-08-21 18:48:25,Thanks for the help. Learned some stuff. I'll have to test when kid's off the computer
2017-08-21 18:46:11,Hi. Any update on a fix for this? Chrome flash is up to date and Freerange is listed as an allowed site in my Chrome settings. Thanks
2017-08-21 18:45:17,My kid's hogging it no need to reply
2017-08-21 18:44:05,My test results are lower than expected and thats the 5G
2017-08-21 18:42:13,Oh and how do I get the wifi to stop trying to link on the old network/router ??
2017-08-21 18:37:19,I haven't done them nor do I know how ?

2017-08-21 10:27:30,@Shawhelp who do I contact about my bill? I was charged for a second shaw box but the tech only hooked up one...
2017-08-21 10:13:43,@Shawhelp are there phones be & internet outages in Strathmore?
2017-08-21 09:18:03,"today, the speedtest actually shows only 10 up, which is probably accurate, but still sucks because it's been this way for 2-3 weeks."
2017-08-21 09:17:03,I live stream on YouTube 3 times a week and I've had to drop my bitrate by half just to have no lag so viewers have a good experience.
2017-08-21 09:16:18,@Shawhelp the past 2 weeks my upload speed has been bad with internet 150. even though the speedtest shows between 15-17 up.
2017-08-21 08:50:03,"13 year Shaw subscriber here. I know you personally have no say, but you need to say something, Please pass these concerns on."
2017-08-21 08:48:57,left to announce how you are combating it before I'm forced to cancel and go to Bell because I need to get it installed before the season.
2017-08-21 08:48:31,Several doesn't cut it. Other providers will carry every game to combat DAZN and losing NFL Sunday ticket. You guys have about 2 days 1/2
2017-08-21 08:39:53,@Shawhelp are there any plans to carry additional time shifting channels to get all the NFL games this year like @Bell and others are?

2017-08-20 20:48:26,It's just internet traffic that is routing properly.
2017-08-20 20:48:09,Not possible. Would require a whole lot of network changes to get things connected. I use passthrough local traffic is running properly
2017-08-20 20:44:52,How did you know what address in referring to? And yes 2 ip. Run 2 networks

2017-08-20 18:22:58,It was probably a decade for me as well. But I've never had an iota of the internet problems with Shaw that I had with Telus.
2017-08-20 18:07:51,Telus has no shame when it comes to trying to get customers. They also have no interest in keeping a customer.
2017-08-20 17:58:36,"I used Telus a decade ago, so I'm not sure how reliable it is right now. But this kind of business practices should be stopped."

2017-08-20 17:47:58,I'm okay with paying more for a more reliable product.
2017-08-20 17:06:20,Still no internet and tv in Aldergrove. Will you post it as soon as it's back online? Thanks.
2017-08-20 16:03:09,"Most persistent salespeople ever, they just *won't* leave. Very unprofessional of Telus."
2017-08-20 15:40:48,. @TELUS Could you stop sending people to tell residents that @Shawhelp customers are overpaying for their internet? Just stop.
2017-08-20 14:45:18,A day....no way you can justify billing me as much as you do. I need a break on my bill because the services are just so bad all the time...
2017-08-20 14:44:32,Constantly having troubles my wifi is done for the 4th day in a row and the only way to fix it is to call in and be on hold for 10 mins
2017-08-20 14:31:11,It never works anywhere
2017-08-20 14:24:06,@Shawhelp Your Shaw Open sucks. It never works. All it does is disrupt my internet service! FIX IT
2017-08-20 14:12:22,What does DM mean? Sorry not great with twitter.
2017-08-20 14:09:42,@Shawhelp is there an ETA on the Aldergrove outage? It's been like 6hrs
2017-08-20 13:44:14,@Shawhelp we are having a tough time contacting shaw help via phone. Can you add voice mail back to my Moms home phone?
2017-08-20 13:20:10,"Much appreciated! I'd buy you tim Hortons if I could, have a good day!"
2017-08-20 13:09:19,Shaws request line is a sham.. you guys give HD options for crap like Hifi and Love Nature.. but not NFL. What's your retention number?
2017-08-20 12:52:18,You services are brutal...absolutely brutal. More like Shaw 150kbps
2017-08-20 12:50:38,This internet is brutal and I'm sick of calling every 2 days to get everything working. This is brutal Shaw. Absolutely brutal...
2017-08-20 12:42:58,Actually I live in Aldergrove as well and my internet isn't working ever since I woke up today. This isn't normal. Hopefully it's back soon?
2017-08-20 12:37:39,@Shawhelp do you have any cable packages available where one can purchase the mcgregor/mayweather fight?
2017-08-20 12:36:52,@Shawhelp why can't I watch a NFL preseason games in HD? On top of losing Redzone.. we can't even get HD options for preseason..
2017-08-20 12:27:28,"I'm hoping we'll hear a ""stayed tuned"" soon."
2017-08-20 12:26:28,"@Shawhelp I hope there's a plan for airing as many NFL games as possible, I will never switch to some streaming service. RedZone was great."

2017-08-19 13:04:47,@Shawhelp your help line is great at responding but problem hasn't changed. What's the deal?!
2017-08-19 13:03:28,@Shawhelp is @TELUS right that even though I pay 4 Shaw150 I'm still sharing it w/ others? Would explain why internet cuts out consistently
2017-08-19 12:57:02,It's in the next room upstairs. I tried a reboot yesterday and today it's still the same.
2017-08-19 12:54:14,Currently 5g
2017-08-19 12:51:57,@Shawhelp has there been any issues in Winnipeg regarding speed? I'm paying for 150 and seem to be getting 35-40
2017-08-19 12:00:27,"Yes, but my point is that these licensing agreements should move & improve w the times & embrace bingeing! Watching from beginning is fun!"

2017-08-18 23:22:20,"I didn't watch, but the picture for the Philly game was pretty crisp last night but the FPS still wasn't up to par yet"
2017-08-18 23:19:20,Praying that Shaw picks up some more regional CTV stations in HD
2017-08-18 23:17:06,10-4! I KNOW I spend too much money to go sailing ... but that gives ultimate joy unlike the @Rogers and @Bell monopoly re @Shawhelp

2017-08-18 22:32:51,The first light after the power light is blinking. Hitron CGNM-2250 modem. I've tried unplugging the power twice
2017-08-18 22:26:13,Also lost internet in south Edmonton.
2017-08-18 22:22:30,"@shawcable @Shawhelp Well, with what happens more than it should, and I pay for HBO too, you guys make the case for Netflix by the day."
2017-08-18 22:21:06,"@Shawhelp More specifically, the signal is there and our devices are connected, but we're getting nothing. Even rebooted modem."

2017-08-18 22:18:09,@Shawhelp I guess I set the PVR for the midnight repeat. Hopefully that stays on and I get to see the 1st half of the show now missed.
2017-08-18 22:14:30,"Shouldn’t blame HBO, @Shawhelp seems to have a hard time keeping signals on the air."
2017-08-18 22:11:43,"@Shawhelp Wow, 2 minutes into Live Realtime with Bill Maher, you lose the signal? I hate to say it, but this is why I cancelled HBO before."
2017-08-18 22:11:13,"@Shawhelp We have lost Internet, too. South side Edmonton."
2017-08-18 22:05:55,I got a response via direct message. Said to simply not watch & order will nullify itself but made note on acct to void 2. Thnks @Shawhelp !

2017-08-18 20:29:38,@Shawhelp will you guys offer all NFL games through timeshift via Shaw Direct? I know Bell & Telus are offering it.
2017-08-18 20:12:01,Thanks for standing by!

2017-08-18 17:20:32,People might start flocking over there it's a pretty big deal for nfl fans
2017-08-18 17:20:01,Thanks I don't know who makes these calls but Shaw should be talking to Bell about getting more since they claim to be showing all NFL games
2017-08-18 17:18:05,Do you know when you'll find out? Season starts in three weeks.
2017-08-18 17:15:45,"@Shawhelp @ShawInfo Quick question, are you gaining access to more CTV channels on your guide for the football season?"
2017-08-18 17:14:54,@Shawhelp Bell is offering EVERY NFL game on Sunday through their timeshift package. Will you guys be doing the same?
2017-08-18 17:14:50,I was. I'm with Telus now.
2017-08-18 17:12:40,You get NFL Network in HD? You're obviously not with @Shawhelp

2017-08-18 14:06:38,@Shawhelp 27 mins on hold waiting to talk to someone does not make me very happy. Finally hung up. What's going on!?!?!?

2017-08-18 13:42:06,When @shawhelp calls you up and says we have to cancel your appointment due to man power issues wonder what that really means. #HireMoreHelp

2017-08-18 12:53:24,"@Shawhelp , You need to integrate your #BlueSkyTV accounts with your other accounts. 20 minutes repeating info to the Rep(s) is obnoxious"

2017-08-18 09:52:18,I didn't know you can't get Bell TV in BC? They never mentioned that when I was on the phone with them yesterday.
2017-08-18 09:50:04,I'm stuck too. At least I can stream it on my mobile devices. I have a 4 screen tv setup that's totally messed though.
2017-08-18 09:48:04,@Shawhelp Hi! I am trying to recover a password so I can get into the new app but I didn't get the email to reset it. Ugh
2017-08-18 09:47:07,hey @Shawhelp why do you make it so easy to sign up but such a pain in the ass to cancel
2017-08-18 09:15:52,How about about you just tell your techs to set things up securely to begin with.
2017-08-18 09:14:35,Anyone know of a decent 3rd party router that works well with @Shawhelp Openwide 150 modem/router? Need for gaming/streaming..
2017-08-18 09:10:35,Shaw did not even give them administrative access to this gear.
2017-08-18 09:09:52,This has happened to two of my clients because you talked them into it. They had no idea what you setup until i visited.
2017-08-18 08:26:15,And I'm over here stuck with DAZN. RIP 2017-2018 football season.
2017-08-18 08:24:59,I just got all the channel from @Bell that give me all the football games. I'm ready to go boys! Fuck @DAZN_CA
2017-08-18 08:06:26,"Yeah we don't even have the option of Bell in BC, HOPEFULLY Shaw finds a way I hate DAZN."

2017-08-18 07:40:20,So probably not very likely.
2017-08-18 07:39:57,"Colin, Bell owns CTV & TSN where the games will be shown, I imagine Shaw would have to make a deal to add extra CTV chans to their lineup."
2017-08-18 07:30:18,@Shawhelp will you be gettting this timeshifting feature to show every NFL game on tv?
2017-08-18 06:35:09,@Shawhelp waiting from Saturday for a call to fix a billing issue on a promotional offer that wasn't even installed in the first place.
2017-08-18 06:33:49,@Shawhelp ok so three months in and your service is terrible. Billing issues. Channel issues and no one willing to actually follow up.
2017-08-17 23:06:26,@Shawhelp how to get a show go wifi hot spot in my business?
2017-08-17 23:05:02,Thanks will you guys be trying to show extra games this year or is that undecided?

2017-08-17 22:41:25,@Shawhelp Hello! Suddenly I can't find Game of Thrones in the VOD HBOCanafa section. Thought I did before. Where are the series? Thanks!
2017-08-17 22:21:13,@Shawhelp Will you be timeshifting to cover all NFL games as a work around to DAZN as Bell has advertised they will be?
2017-08-17 21:45:02,"@Shawhelp are you having a problem with devices trying to connect? If I switch between routers I've got a 50/50 of ""connected no internet""."
2017-08-17 21:40:42,$100 deal for @Shawhelp @ShawInfo only applicable to upgrades to Slim & you have to acquire BlueSky. Read Small Print #cdnpoli #Canada #Shaw
2017-08-17 21:03:20,"Wi-Fi. Internet 75. Nothing has been tried, appletv and our phones/tabs/comp worked great last week before Shaw came here to ""upgrade"" us."
2017-08-17 20:56:36,"@shawhelp How is that after you ""upgrade"" us to 3x faster internet, it's the slowest internet I've had in years? #dialupwasfaster #nonetflix"
2017-08-17 20:24:07,"Lol well played, but after more years than we can count we are leaving @Shawhelp due to poor service and lack of appreciation. #breakingup"
2017-08-17 20:08:45,That’s ok. Tired of waiting for someone to respond.
2017-08-17 20:06:01,@Shawhelp Can someone contact me to discuss my services? I’m not interested in talking to someone who is helping others at the same time.
2017-08-17 19:46:20,Sure thing.
2017-08-17 19:44:17,Do you guys give out t-shirts or caps to streamers?
2017-08-17 19:40:32,Upgraded my current internet 150 1TB plan to the Unlimited 150 plan thanks @Shawhelp @ShawInfo time to stream Unlimited
2017-08-17 19:30:20,Wall jack
2017-08-17 19:26:08,I would Switch to Shaw Mobile in a heartbeat
2017-08-17 19:26:07,I would but Shaw on Demand is working on the Motorola now. It should work ALL THE TIME.
2017-08-17 19:20:04,If it was called Shaw Mobile everyone would switch including me
2017-08-17 19:15:18,Hi Ken! I haven't. It it would be nice if it was called Shaw Mobile
2017-08-17 19:14:21,Motorola but I don't use the other one much
2017-08-17 18:42:43,Sounds good! DM'd!
2017-08-17 18:39:02,@Shawhelp Setting up new cable box and getting no IP error. Have tried resetting and re plugging all cables
2017-08-17 18:34:24,Hey @Shawhelp .. u had Internet client have speed test issues with win 10 post creators update? Thanks.
2017-08-17 18:19:38,That's great to hear. @DAZN_CA is absolutely awful so I can't cut my cable...yet. The NFL is the only thing holding me back
2017-08-17 18:14:49,Wow. So Shaw Direct should show all games and most will be in HD. Wicked news! Why doesn't @Shawhelp provide similar service
2017-08-17 17:58:22,Hi @Shawhelp @ShawInfo When will you have shaw mobility we need better phone plans and a better phone network. #shawftw
2017-08-17 17:44:17,High speed is an advertisement moniker? High speed is a descriptive term.
2017-08-17 17:43:15,"A supervisor already ""helped"" next stop consumer affairs. False advertising."
2017-08-17 17:42:46,@Shawhelp was on the phone with a supervisor saying the name of the package has nothing to do with the speed of the internet.
2017-08-17 17:41:56,@Shawhelp that's false advertising. Calling something high speed when it's not?
2017-08-17 17:40:22,"@Shawhelp been paying this ""high speed"" thought is was computer making it slow, get new computer, find out shaw is lying about its service"
2017-08-17 17:39:42,Bell figured it out. Gonna play all nfl games using their regional CTV channels.
2017-08-17 17:39:25,@Shawhelp also won't discount to any of the new plans because discount is only for new customers. We thought we had high speed internet
2017-08-17 17:38:56,Bell will be offering all games via timeshift CTV regional channels. Hope Shaw follows suit
2017-08-17 17:38:45,When @Shawhelp bill says you're getting high speed internet & you find out max download is 7mbps and max upload is 1mbps. False advertising
2017-08-17 17:13:01,K. Huge buzz right now as ppl in Canada not happy with #dazn so this is a great plan by Bell to combat
2017-08-17 17:08:51,Same question to @Shawhelp
2017-08-17 17:08:18,@Bell now offers 15 dif regional CTV channels to enable ability to show all Sunday NFL games with the timeshift package
2017-08-17 17:07:07,@Shawhelp any plan to add more HD regional CTV feeds prior to @NFL season. @CTV_Television showing different games regionally this season.
2017-08-17 17:05:26,Bell now has 15 regional CTV channels in HD. They will show dif games in dif regions. That's how they will show all games
2017-08-17 17:04:09,Im having the same issue. This happened shortly after our power got cut
2017-08-17 16:58:25,Looks like TV is currently down too.
2017-08-17 16:56:54,@Shawhelp Is Shaw internet having issues at the moment? I've tried unplugging my router a bunch of times already and still no Internet.
2017-08-17 16:56:31,"@Shawhelp just had a power outage in my home. For some reason, the internet isn't working. Tried replugging the modem, but it's it working."
2017-08-17 16:50:11,"It's all good, I got my account closed. Thanks tho"
2017-08-17 16:24:11,Since past 2-3 weeks my internet connection is swaying and I'm getting alot of interruptions while browsing. Can you help?

2017-08-17 14:05:21,@Shawhelp Quick question about FreeRangeTV's On Demand selection - is it just movies or TV/Documentaries too? Thinking of ditching Netflix
2017-08-17 13:05:42,I want access to all games like before. Is that not an option?
2017-08-17 12:59:02,@Shawhelp how is the best way to watch NFL games now that Sunday ticket is gone?
2017-08-17 12:56:33,"@Shawhelp we had a meeting last week to upgrade our package that you guys rescheduled on us to today, and now you guys are 2 hrs late, help?"
2017-08-17 11:57:54,"Thank you, I appreciate it! She was a doll! :)"

2017-08-08 13:44:00,So I can't just take my router in and tell them to end my service?
2017-08-08 13:40:05,Just wondering if I can end my service in the middle of my billing cycle and pay per day

2017-08-08 12:49:44,"just the Mail program on my MacBook air. It is connected in all other ways, receiving email too."
2017-08-08 12:48:16,@Shawhelp I put in a move request 4 days ago but heard nothing since. I know it was a holiday but I thought I'd have heard something by now.
2017-08-08 12:44:07,"Apparently due to "" @TELUSsupport interference"". Telus probably just flipped the wrong switch.. Competent work there."

2017-08-08 12:29:30,@Shawhelp any idea why I suddenly can’t send email from my laptop (but can on other computers) and it says Shaw is offline?
2017-08-08 12:23:24,It was one of TMN channels. M3 I think. Definitely not the kind of movie the guide indicated it was going to be.
2017-08-08 12:22:45,TY but what's frustrating more then removing something first then Head office doesn't tell you either in advance or later
2017-08-08 12:15:39,Ok Sorry sitting in the OR waiting room in a nut shell what should I be doing to get picture back while veiwing guide
2017-08-08 12:11:23,Thanks @Shawhelp for helping me with my problem. You did great. However you need to work on your call wait times.
2017-08-08 12:04:19,@MeTV why are you available is Vancouver Canada via @Shawhelp and not Edmonton?
2017-08-08 12:04:08,Well I've been through this multiple times before and it never seems to get resolved. Blue sky tv is terrible

2017-08-08 10:29:43,"""Free Rental""? That's an oxymoron. The definition of rental does not include 'free'. Y'all have my information from the previous dozen times"
2017-08-08 10:21:35,Why? I just told you I'm in no financial position to pay for a new PVR (& I'm certainly not going to rent equipment.)
2017-08-08 10:20:20,"It was channel 29. I don't pay for movies. The price I pay for my cable, I shouldn't have to pay for movies on top of that."

2017-08-08 10:15:18,Y'all have stepped in in the past. Got me to 'unplug' & jump thru hoops. Nothing has worked. I'm done trying. Shaw is super friendly...
2017-08-08 10:12:57,...the screen never came back. DELETE!! It's an issue I've had since the machine was new. Shaw never helped then. Why would they now?
2017-08-08 10:11:45,"...then it froze The picture just stopped. Indicator said it was playing, but it was frozen. didn't work. I stopped & restarted, but..."
2017-08-08 10:10:11,"In this specific situation, I was watching the movie ""Killing Them Softly"". The PVR waited 32min, until I was invested in the story..."
2017-08-08 10:04:45,"An issue that continues to frustrate me, but I'm in no position to buy a new PVR. So, I'll live with the shortcomings until I can."
2017-08-08 10:03:18,"I know, but what would be the point? The PVR would still screw up again next week or the week after. It's an issue I've learned to live with"
2017-08-08 09:58:46,"Why bother? Movie was from a week ago. Plus, every time ya ""help"".., ya really don't. I'm tired of jumping thru hoops only to fail again."
2017-08-08 09:10:37,@Shawhelp I have sent you a DM

2017-08-06 15:57:37,@Shawhelp ur field tects suck in lloydminster Alberta. It takes 3 weeks to get a new modem. Its just a quick switch for a new modem .
2017-08-06 15:37:08,@Shawhelp is gateway still available? Or has blue sky replaced service?
2017-08-06 15:36:04,@Shawhelp might be time to put speed limiters on your service vans. Tired of your crew racing for the Lonsdale light from W23rd.

2017-08-05 21:01:53,I know why. It's to deceive the new customers to thinking that the regular price hasn't been bumped up 5 bucks. Nice tactic.
2017-08-05 21:01:02,I get it free with Telus through the HBO package.
2017-08-05 20:55:41,No problem just letting you know

2017-08-03 08:32:17,Yea. It does have both. So if I log into wifi 5.0 it should be higher?
2017-08-03 08:29:56,"Did a speed test, wifi and wired, and wifi is waaaaay lower. Curious if that can be raised to match wired."
2017-08-03 08:27:10,No. All the lights are on on the modem. The wifi light is flashing that's it. But sometimes I get a message on the TV re: network function
2017-08-03 08:23:22,Morning guys. I have a question if you've got some time.
2017-08-03 08:08:08,"Telus will have a 250 mbit connection this winter, will Shaw match speeds?"

2017-08-01 14:47:37,You can not expect us to continue to pay for services we are not getting for 10 days without some kind of fix before then.
2017-08-01 14:46:16,@Shawhelp I find it unacceptable that we've been without service for a day but the earliest a tech can come help us is August 10th.

2017-07-30 15:18:09,@Shawhelp Could I get some help adding a channel onto my package please? :)
2017-07-30 15:05:26,@Shawhelp blue sky does not make thing easy. Actually three times harder!!! You need to rethink!!! Ask your customers.
2017-07-30 14:47:27,Can you find out? Lol.. there's nobody else that would know!
2017-07-30 14:44:16,"happens with naps on the couch, hopefully when it's a PVRed thing. Rewind works too. Thanks to @Shawhelp"

2017-07-30 14:03:13,I will.

2017-07-30 09:48:18,Just don't forget the bacon.
2017-07-30 09:42:41,Best is bacon on every pizza. Add smoked baby oysters on the seafood pizza. Not a fan of the pineapple.
2017-07-30 09:41:44,Best - thin crust dbl pepperoni. Worst - thick crust anything with olives.
2017-07-30 09:30:10,"Thank you, Ken for the quick response! Will do"

2017-07-29 18:42:11,"I was going to stream rearranging the office, but surprise!!! My @Shawhelp internet is borked."

2017-07-29 18:41:07,"Yeah, they're fine now."

2017-07-29 18:20:22,@Shawhelp I have twice sent in emails asking for pricing info. No answer. I assume you guys don't want new business coming from a competitor

2017-07-29 15:53:35,"Thanks for your fast response, Lance. Tell me, can I load the TMN GO app on Apple TV?"
2017-07-29 15:46:02,How do i find content through SOD? I have an old remote.
2017-07-29 15:42:56,"I'm always telling people not to download. Why, I don't know. You guys are digging your own grave"
2017-07-29 15:38:17,@Shawhelp @HBOCanada Just spent 30 min trying to get Shaw to explain to me how I access streaming content. No one could explain it.
2017-07-29 14:11:19,@Shawhelp Where on VOD is the movie Dr. No? It appears to be on the VOD website but not on my tv.
2017-07-29 14:10:21,"@Shawhelp hi, we've switched to telus (sorry), and we still have your box. What do we do with it?"

2017-07-29 13:16:39,And the Telus people are busy upgrading my crescent. I do not currently have plans to switch.
2017-07-29 13:14:54,"Maybe in time. But for now I'm too mad. BTW, I currently have highest internet service you provide and 4 cable boxes."
2017-07-29 13:09:49,But you guys have no such service. And long queues for in house help. I would pay $100 an hour for this type of help.
2017-07-29 13:07:50,I'm too angry to call you guys. I have to get calm before I call you. I would happily pay for a shaw person to come help me at my home...
2017-07-29 13:06:02,"6) if shaw's direction is talking into a remote while eating food, I'm out. That's disgusting!! Imagine looking into top of remote"
2017-07-29 13:03:05,5) I enjoyed free preview of HBO Canada. Watched everything. Went to search for HBO Canada and these shows. THEY are not ANYWHERE!
2017-07-29 13:01:01,"4) on demand 'documentaries'. I love watching documentaries. When I select documentaries I first see 'dishonesty', FOR MONTHS!!! Change!!"
2017-07-29 12:58:35,3) programming. I was loving watching real time with bill Mayer. Then about a month ago 'poof' it's gone. Why?
2017-07-29 12:54:56,Then when I came back to shaw the install guy said - 'there was a software fix for that'. At the time I had the gateway shaw could not fix.
2017-07-29 12:52:47,2) I had shaw gateway years ago. Then went to another provider because this gateway seemed to reset at the end of every hour on the hour...
2017-07-29 12:50:50,1) menu-recordings-select season/series-select an episode-select 'delete this recording'. Used to be able to delete whole series. Not now.

2017-07-28 22:46:43,Apparently our email accounts got stuck being moved from the old to new servers. Hubby realized he's had no mail since Tuesday!

2017-07-26 16:06:02,@Shawhelp the interface on my pvr is so terrible that I've started using the TMN app and appletv to watch HBO Can I please have an upgrade?
2017-07-26 16:00:55,"Imagine if Netflix.ca showed you content that was only available on US Netflix, erroring out every time to selected something, that's cable."
2017-07-26 15:35:01,Why is it my responsibility to add functionality to your service. You guys couldn't even put a green 'active' dot beside the channels?
2017-07-26 15:26:07,"Hi @Shawhelp I'm upgrading my Internet pkg online. I already have Advanced wifi modem, don't want another, but I can't opt out on the form."
2017-07-26 15:15:49,What a joke @Shawhelp please resolve this asap
2017-07-26 15:05:49,"no worries, it was just a let down after being excitedly told there was a dedicated Welcome Home Team to handle my move. Will DM you!"

2017-07-26 13:40:28,@Shawhelp I just reset my router bc of periodic interruptions/drops in the connection. Now it just won't connect at all.
2017-07-26 12:49:07,I was referring to auto-blocking known spammers.
2017-07-26 12:45:20,My new provider actually provides great features to block unwanted calls. Shaw should consider joining them in the 21 century.
2017-07-26 12:25:16,"Quotation marks just to emphasize. Field guy, fast, professional, all round good experience with him."

2017-07-25 22:16:15,"Well played, LD! ;-)"
2017-07-25 22:14:21,"We will be visiting the retail store to see what they can offer. I hope it's good. Option 2 is moving to Telus, but not right now."

2017-07-25 17:37:48,It works fine. It's the quality and mess that is your interface. The thing Shaw designed. Why would anybody pay 100 bucks a month for this?
2017-07-25 16:26:20,"Yes, but it says it is the wrong credentials"

2017-07-19 22:18:16,I am not sure what you mean by an overbooking? We were told we would have a tech here first thing in the morning. I hope that's the case.
2017-07-19 22:14:46,No. My home phone and internet were not yet connected or working at all when he left.
2017-07-19 22:12:39,Seemed in a rush to hit the road. Happily leaving us with out 2 of our 3 newly ordered services....
2017-07-19 22:12:13,Thank you.I'm not trying to take out our frustrations on you.My family uses the net for work.The tech was upset he missed his lunch...
2017-07-19 22:09:42,"We have talked w/tech support.Our modem is ""dead""?Except the tech seemed as he knew there was something wrong w/it before he left our home."
2017-07-19 22:06:29,First day as Shaw customers & already the customer service isn't looking so green on the other side of the fence. #bummer
2017-07-19 22:05:48,Thanx;not that naive. #sarcasm I'm not naive enough to pay for services I'm not receiving either.Thankful there's a 10 cancellation window.
2017-07-19 21:59:59,"@Shawhelp A self-install modem kit was sent to me. I want to send it back. Went to Canada post, said I need special shipment number to send?"
2017-07-19 21:55:20,@Shawhelp 1st 12 hours as a Shaw customer are not going well. Do you guys plan to reimburse us for our cel data we have to use tonight now?
2017-07-19 21:39:28,Shaw has the best customer service of all the household services we use. @Shawhelp
2017-07-19 21:21:53,@Shawhelp not sure when it started but I really like the S1/Ep3 codes that are now showing on shows. Very nice.
2017-07-19 21:13:47,It only shows Season Five. But if you click that it shows just the last four episodes of Season 1
2017-07-19 21:10:36,Hi @Shawhelp having trouble getting The Wire in the On Demand menu. Only shows Season 5 but even it isn't there...

2017-07-19 18:18:49,@Shawhelp to Nathan in Wpg Loyalty Dept. for making me a happy customer and taking care of my concerns.
2017-07-19 18:18:24,@Shawhelp Internet just suddenly stopped working in Red Deer. Is there an outage?
2017-07-19 18:03:37,"The Channel packages would need to be updated, the last time they were updated was back in 2013 for #yeg , that is."
2017-07-19 17:56:48,"Of corse, these are the new channels."
2017-07-19 17:55:57,It's listed in that list.
2017-07-19 17:55:43,"Interesting, Stingray Retro? I believe I don't have that network"
2017-07-19 17:50:51,"Apparently, it's still being shown here. I've got the Gateway system. I can provide my account info via DM if needed."
2017-07-19 17:45:34,@shawhelp I thought that the free preview for BET has already expired.
2017-07-19 15:57:16,"@Shawhelp in NW Calgary, we have ordered Trolls in VOD and my system keeps freezing when we try playing the movie, what should we do"
2017-07-19 15:05:15,Such is the way of things... there are always.... alternatives...
2017-07-19 15:03:58,I feel for ya. This is one of the best races of the year. Too bad #NASCAR only recognizes fans in the US.
2017-07-19 14:59:48,"Good to know. Happy for Eastern Canada, I guess. Western Canada still gets nothing. @Shawhelp certainly won't do anything about it."
2017-07-19 14:54:50,Thank you. And thank heavens for kids movies on dvd lol
2017-07-19 14:51:51,@Shawhelp ... any word on how long the outage in Lacombe Park area of St. Albert will be going on?
2017-07-19 14:42:48,It's not like KSPS is even a accessible option on my cable package...
2017-07-19 14:38:00,Bad news. When I booked it I accidentally entered the wrong information and it submitted. I then entered the proper information & sent again
2017-07-19 14:30:44,"Before then, for a year worked no problem on the 30mbps"
2017-07-19 14:30:21,Speed test are fine but the dropping of service seems to be a huuuuuge headache that started a few weeks ago unannounced ...
2017-07-19 14:29:32,Everything loads. Online gaming drops constantly. Had techs out. Went from 30 to 150 and swapped modem. Line to the house has to be wrecked
2017-07-19 14:26:37,@Shawhelp anyone know the difference between the 30 Mbps and the 150 Mbps services? Cause I don't see any at all.... #dissapointed
2017-07-19 13:17:17,"Hmm that kind of sucks for current customers having to pay over 2 times more, especially being a long time customer."
2017-07-19 12:18:06,https://www. shaw.ca/store/internet /internetPackageDetails.jsp?prodId=prod1480004#tabInfo … this is the promo am I talking about.
2017-07-19 12:14:40,It’s back up after 10 mins down. Is a long term fix coming? This is very disruptive.
2017-07-19 12:14:08,"Thanks for the swift reply, But what if I do the upgrade online via your website, am I eligable for the $49.90 for the first year promo?"
2017-07-19 12:09:51,And now it’s back down again… four times so far this month. Not sure what I’m paying for at this point.
2017-07-19 12:07:39,"The fact that the interjected ""data"" is also from public tv ....."
2017-07-19 10:51:31,There is also one of the noise reduction do not remove plugged directly in the modem
2017-07-19 10:50:57,So I live in a condo and decided to remove a couple panels and this is what I found behind the wall where my modem is pic.twitter.com/rQ5wv01LM2
2017-07-19 10:39:19,Direct to wall
2017-07-19 10:38:41,My Wi-Fi router is not pulling an IP address from the Shaw modem
2017-07-19 10:38:04,It's my internet keeps dropping. I have rebooted Shaw modem and my Wi-Fi router. After modem reboot worked for a bit and now out again
2017-07-19 10:35:32,"@Shawhelp Hey, just curious if there is currently issues in Discovery Ridge in Calgary or if It is just me?"
2017-07-19 10:31:58,"Hi @martin_fff , this can sometimes happen if a cable TV system loses a signal, and needs to temporarily replace with with an alternative."

2017-07-19 01:45:20,@Shawhelp does upgrading from High Speed 25 to internet 150 include a new modem change? Also do I get the online promo?
2017-07-18 22:56:26,About the same... roughly a dozen seconds
2017-07-18 22:50:12,@KSPSpublicTV just broke into the @KCTS9 signal again ~9:49pm PDST

2017-07-18 19:05:45,Ok. I'll look at this and see what I can sort out.
2017-07-18 19:01:22,No 5g listed. And even beside the modem etc it tests as slow on my phone.
2017-07-18 18:59:22,"Copy. We have two Comps , I pad and phone in use currently. I don't see the 5g on my phone."
2017-07-18 18:54:25,How would I identify if it's 5g?

2017-07-18 18:42:05,Great. I tested beside modem & download speed was greatly improved. I'll try a few things & then see what I can troubleshoot

2017-07-18 16:36:59,Not yet but other things plugged into the same outlet are back up and fine.
2017-07-18 16:36:19,Now I'm realizing there's a power outage in my neighbourhood. Makes sense. Will modem just come back online by itself later?
2017-07-18 16:32:57,"@Shawhelp Help! Power seemed to cut for a second and everything came back online but the modem. Tried power cycling, no lights, no luck."
2017-07-18 15:43:32,I called the number on my bill - they said the wait would be 5-15 mins
2017-07-18 15:36:48,@Shawhelp your business solutions SUCK! Have been on hold for 38 minutes! Absurd

2017-07-18 14:36:41,Have reset everything. Still down.
2017-07-18 14:33:46,Last two times were confirmed issues in my area. A few of the lights out on modem today.
2017-07-18 14:17:17,@Shawhelp - Internet is down in Abbotsford for the third time in two weeks. This is getting really disruptive.
2017-07-18 13:30:25,Unfortunately shaw doesnt provide that same type of service. Wish they did.
2017-07-18 13:15:47,Good info
2017-07-18 13:02:42,Telus supplies extenders. They did a full check of my place and made sure there was good wifi signal throughout.
2017-07-18 12:54:04,Those little quick outages hurts my business. When is it going to be finished?
2017-07-18 12:53:12,@Shawhelp Hello. Any known outages for internet in the Edmonton area? Mine was working until about 20 minutes ago

2017-07-18 11:52:49,"@Shawhelp why is getting what you want from Shaw so difficult !!!! OMG ,Telus here I come"

2017-07-18 11:05:31,Yup
2017-07-18 11:05:13,Theyres nothing they can do your best option is to buy a wifi repeater
2017-07-18 11:00:38,Lol sorry doesnt help when youre going over your cellphone data every month. It is what it is.
2017-07-18 10:56:58,Yup. Honestly every suggestion you guys have made doesnt work. Been buying different extenders but those crap out too.
2017-07-18 10:56:12,Yeah would help if they provided some sort of solution instead of dishing out $100s out of our pocket just to get some connection
2017-07-18 10:49:23,"Size, concrete, walls all that matters unfortunately not much shaw can do there"
2017-07-18 10:39:58,Whats the point of paying $100 a month for internet if you have to go buy more products to get full coverage around your house @Shawhelp
2017-07-18 10:25:30,@Shawhelp Spotty internet in Victoria/Saanich.... just me?

2017-07-15 19:14:48,@Shawhelp having outages with internet and tv in airdrie ab
2017-07-15 19:13:56,"you also ,"
2017-07-15 19:13:11,"yep, self installed and using right now"
2017-07-15 19:11:02,do I need to wait a certain amount of time to set up my Shaw ID? pic.twitter.com/emHlZ5V5W2
2017-07-15 19:06:53,What a difference!
2017-07-15 19:02:53,before... AND AFTER! @nucleusinc vs @Shawhelp for the same price pic.twitter.com/bajb9FrHyn
2017-07-15 18:52:40,"thank you as my daughter asked me to do this and i am not good on twitter, lol, you are such a big help as their tv and internet is out"
2017-07-15 18:48:31,@Shawhelp is there any outages in new westminster for tv and internet
2017-07-15 18:25:27,"Telus is solid for internet and TV. Now doing 4k, you can prob snag a new TV on a 2 year deal"
2017-07-15 18:13:05,Thanks! Unfortunately you're not in service yet where I live. Thanks anyway!
2017-07-15 17:42:35,And we're happy to answer any questions you might have :) https:// frdm.mobi/2ts99nG ^RP
2017-07-15 17:30:15,Thanks! You too
2017-07-15 17:28:57,Does Shaw have mobile service?
2017-07-15 17:27:24,We've been with Telus 10+ years. No complaints until we switched to fiber optic. 5 service issues the last 3 months. Patience wearing thin.
2017-07-15 17:27:03,Happily with your competition for the last 6 years..
2017-07-15 17:18:21,Telus .. Shaw raised prices on me twice in a year.. and a complete hassle to switch
2017-07-15 17:08:07,And 4k channels. Tricky to chose regardless... Oh and with the fires shaw was down. But you guys are doing a great job - my rental has shaw
2017-07-15 17:07:01,"Yes, that's nice, but I have to weigh it up against a cheaper contract and a free 4K TV, hence the difficulty..."
2017-07-15 17:05:31,And I understand for a second tv you need a second box? It's not wireless to all tvs?
2017-07-15 17:03:46,Our city seem to be full of your open shaw wifi! Even at my gym!
2017-07-15 16:58:46,"Do you have fibre optic cables and 4K channels? I'v not made my mind up and not trying to promote them, but you'd have to convince me"
2017-07-15 16:51:58,@Shawhelp do you give free 4K TV's like telus do? Asking for a friend
2017-07-15 16:40:59,Dammit @Shawhelp my ShawOpen is wonky and it's not my phone. #fml #firstworldproblems #wantmywifi
2017-07-15 15:25:56,"@Shawhelp Can't find what free channels are offered this week on our shaw tv... any suggestions? Also, we need help to get more channels"
2017-07-15 13:51:11,nvm it's $14.99 on Xbox LOL
2017-07-15 13:49:39,Doesn't playstation and Xbox have an app where you can get HBO cheaper?
2017-07-15 13:32:24,I've always been happy with Shaw. Great customer service.
2017-07-15 13:26:00,Another vote for Shaw.
2017-07-15 13:01:27,Interesting differentiator. Thanks!
2017-07-15 13:00:52,Appreciate the tip! That's helpful
2017-07-15 13:00:20,"Cool, thanks for the tip!"

2017-07-15 12:59:38,Appreciate the recommendation!
2017-07-15 12:59:24,"Awesome, thanks Bruce!"
2017-07-15 12:55:49,GoT
2017-07-15 12:41:38,For what GOT? Or Westworld?
2017-07-15 12:41:01,SH-AW YEAH....... I'll see myself out
2017-07-15 12:37:30,Well @Shawhelp wants to charge me $18/month for a package to get HBO. That’s a big nope lol. What a rip off for a package. Just want 1 chan
2017-07-15 12:12:03,I’ve got Shaw 150 and it’s great. Shaw support is not offshore—big advantage. Telus offers 150 Mbps up/down in certain areas.
2017-07-15 12:09:30,And the best customer service on here! So quick to respond!
2017-07-15 12:00:29,@Shawhelp as useless as a condom in a trailer park
2017-07-15 11:52:47,If you can get @Novusnow do it.
2017-07-15 11:45:09,@Shawhelp can i have a new remote shipped out to me?Im not newhere close 2a shaw store 2go get a new 1. My pause button is finsihed
2017-07-15 11:40:41,Yeah I vote @TELUSsupport as well. Shaw is brutal slow.
2017-07-15 11:40:27,Telus is also awfully slow. Shaw is your best bet Nick.
2017-07-15 11:31:12,For the average consumer these days not much of a difference with the speeds available now but @TELUS is faster with their purefibre.
2017-07-15 11:30:55,Appreciate the quick response! Sounds like you're a fan favorite so far :)
2017-07-15 11:25:59,Shaw
2017-07-15 11:24:45,Telus charges on overage data if ur looking to get wireless. Im hoping to get my family out of telus and over to Shaw.
2017-07-15 11:21:11,I'd go @TELUSsupport as they are doing tons of fiber projects around the lower mainland. 4K and way faster internet.
2017-07-15 11:19:21,"Speedtest and shaw speedtest use the same back end, so I get the same results. Accurate report of U/L speeds, but practical use is low."
2017-07-15 11:14:27,@Shawhelp twitter support is
2017-07-15 11:13:30,you're probably going to get tons of tweets about how bad each is but I've been with Shaw since '02. No complaints
2017-07-15 11:13:21,"Normal on a Shaw speed test, low on http:// testmy.net and DSLReports."
2017-07-15 11:06:01,"@Shawhelp For the past few weeks, Internet 150 plan can't stream to Twitch/FB without 60%+ frame loss. Poor upload speeds. Any ideas?"

2017-07-14 21:35:01,No sports channels. Jumps to $60 per month after three months. Still too much.
2017-07-14 21:28:37,Thanks for the info. Sorry but the bundles are more expensive than what I pay now.

2017-07-13 22:11:00,@Shawhelp no guide info in coquitlam last 4hrs. Tried unpluging for 15sec reboots but still no guide
2017-07-13 21:45:32,@Shawhelp what does the message 'setting up offline environment' mean when you switch the cable box on?
2017-07-13 21:34:02,"And, yes, I DO have a Shaw account."

2017-07-13 20:35:37,"To be fair, they sent me a new router, and the box included return shipping. My old router is just bigger than the new one"

2017-07-13 20:03:45,Time to get a new frequency for Global channel. CTV worked fine. Thanks for your time.
2017-07-13 19:57:25,"I get that. But like I said, it's almost like clockwork and restarting the router does nothing. If I wait it out it resolves itself."
2017-07-13 19:57:02,Most likely signal. Global channel gets very choppy with weather.
2017-07-13 19:54:29,"Tried Chrome, Edge and IE. Same thing."
2017-07-13 19:53:23,Nope. It's not that. Cable hasn't been moved. Other channels work properly.
2017-07-13 19:51:49,Not sure how that will help. 100% fine the rest of the day. Not sure why being able to ping or tracert works fine but can't view website.
2017-07-13 19:51:42,I am sorry for the delay. Please see your DMs. Thanks
2017-07-13 19:50:02,we had an appointment for @Shawhelp technician to move services between 5-7 yesterday. I was here all the time. #noshow #badservice #fail
2017-07-13 19:48:25,It's channel based pixelation. Mostly Global Edmonton.
2017-07-13 19:46:25,Seems fine now again but almost every night for the past week or two around that time it seems to happen for about an hour.
2017-07-13 19:45:46,Both wired and wireless. And yes own router. And yes tried power router and modem off then on again. (1/2)
2017-07-13 19:41:29,I worked 2+ years of needing to be available 24-7. I know what it's like. I've never not appreciated the non 8-5 crowd.
2017-07-13 19:07:04,@Shawhelp what gives? every night for the past couple weeks around this time a lot of sites don't load even though tracert or ping works

2017-07-13 13:09:15,@Shawhelp our internet has been down again since this morning. Why has this happened so often recently?
2017-07-13 13:04:27,Hey @Shawhelp can I get some help?
2017-07-13 12:51:19,Service used to be OK. WHAT HAPPENED?
2017-07-13 12:50:43,My monthly call to @Shawhelp to ask WHY you're not taking payments on a valid card is over 20mins so far... WORST SERVICE EVER #shawfails
2017-07-13 12:31:28,Restart multiple times. Unplug system for five minutes at a time. That sort of thing.
2017-07-13 12:27:11,All our equipment is shaw.
2017-07-13 12:25:32,Wifi. It seems sporadic and slow. Service seems to come and go. All day. Every day. Devices all connect then loses connectivity.
2017-07-13 12:21:23,That's not cool D: Why?!?!?
2017-07-13 12:19:29,"Was hoping to game online w/ my buddies, BUT HEY GUESS WHAT??!! NO INTERNET FOR OVER A MONTH :'( @Shawhelp #crying #whatislife #sorryfriends"

2017-07-13 10:33:58,Thank you. I've submitted it.
2017-07-13 10:28:50,@Shawhelp Any chance that Shaw will have the CW on HD anytime soon?
2017-07-13 10:14:40,Telus is offering a wireless home phone(not a cell) for 10 per mth
2017-07-13 10:08:06,Got an email offering wireless home phones. Do you offer it and what is the difference between a Shaw landline and Telus wireless?
2017-07-13 10:01:50,"Hey, internet came back around 3am PST."
2017-07-13 09:37:59,"Another satisfactory support ""call"" with @Shawhelp Thanks guys! pic.twitter.com/0IMzkZUCBC"

2017-07-13 09:00:58,"Speaking of which, she's using an old Motorola cable modem. I don't suppose you could upgrade her to a fancy wireless cable modem?"
2017-07-13 08:12:13,LLAAAAAANNNNNNNCCCCCCCEEEEE
2017-07-13 08:07:39,"Oh yeah? You should see your collections department when I'm overdue on a few payments. Okay, that's never happened, just kidding."

2017-07-13 02:29:00,@Shawhelp Is your service down in the South Okanagan? I can't connect. I restarted my modem but it didn't help.

2017-07-12 22:02:35,"My screen just froze on a silent black screen. Every time. Good form, Shaw."
2017-07-12 22:01:16,@Shawhelp Is it Shaw that isn't broadcasting Emerg Alerts?! Very dangerous. It hasn't worked for ANY of the tornado warnings. Mon or 2day
2017-07-12 22:00:32,Can't even watch YouTube anymore
2017-07-12 21:58:35,@Shawhelp Internet and TV down in southwood AGAIN! THIS IS 4 DAYS IN A ROW?! THIS IS THE WORST SERVICE I'VE EVER HAD.
2017-07-12 21:58:24,@Shawhelp Is the internet in jasper Alberta just slow now or is it just me.
2017-07-12 21:55:59,"Okay, clearing out my browser cache should help. Thanks!"
2017-07-12 21:29:56,Wasn't an email. I will clean out my browser cache out of abundance of caution.
2017-07-12 21:27:06,Typo popular should be pop-up
2017-07-12 21:25:55,I was on my iPad when I got the survey request.
2017-07-12 21:25:31,"I was on Yahoo reading an article about Microsoft. While I was reading, I got a popular from Shaw asking me to complete a survey."
2017-07-12 21:21:40,"My internet is running smoothly again, thanks to @Shawhelp for their awesomely patient help!"

2017-07-12 21:12:42,"@ShawInfo @ShawHelp Please don't serve pop-up surveys while I am browsing. At best, you are are an unwelcome intrusion."
2017-07-12 21:06:39,This is why people pirate. Should be able to see your shows when everyone else does
2017-07-12 21:03:19,@Shawhelp waddup with this? pic.twitter.com/Y619bjQlv7
2017-07-12 20:50:35,Welcome to my world. I use iTunes for everything and HBO shows don't show up till a month after it finishes airing. It's torture
2017-07-12 20:22:33,Absolutely!
2017-07-12 20:20:00,"And yes unplugged the PVR unit for 10s, replugged - have tried 3x"
2017-07-12 20:19:32,Hmm don't recall if it gave me a number jusy said trouble connecting & a list of quick fixes including rebooting as an option!
2017-07-12 20:17:53,Initially an error message now a black screen!
2017-07-12 20:13:42,"@Shawhelp hi! It seems as if my bluesky is down - have tried rebooting several times & unplugging, anything else I can try?"
2017-07-12 20:12:18,Thank you. That's great to hear. I'll check it out.
2017-07-12 20:08:19,That seemed to work.
2017-07-12 20:03:25,Thx. It's unnerving to see a warning & have it cut out just as they are announcing the affected area. This can't cont. all summer not safe.
2017-07-12 19:59:02,@Shawhelp My wifi has been down since 4pm..GREAT timing as I have a paper due. Why is ur wifi service so unreliable? This happens too often.
2017-07-12 19:58:39,Its been 3 days.. O.o
2017-07-12 19:58:31,Great. I'll do it Sunday morning lol
2017-07-12 19:56:49,"It is, but the emergency alert appears at the top of the screen and is unreadable. System locks up."
2017-07-12 19:50:25,Just on the phone with someone at Shaw
2017-07-12 19:49:46,"No problem. If not for twitter, I wouldn't even know it was an Emerg Alert. I'd hate if the people affected don't get the warning."
2017-07-12 19:48:41,Thank you. Hopefully this can be resolved soon. Especially for those in direct paths of these severe storms.
2017-07-12 19:47:28,"@Shawhelp If I order HBO later this week to watch Game of Thrones, am I gonna have to pay the price for the whole month?"
2017-07-12 19:45:39,Thanks guys! This seemed to happened last time as well and was only happening to #shaw customers
2017-07-12 19:45:00,"@Shawhelp We pay crazy amounts of money, for services that are constantly having issues. Starting to think the Future IS Friendly. #telus ??"
2017-07-12 19:42:24,The new series is going until Sept on your Movie Channel. I'm sure people will want to catch up with the original.
2017-07-12 19:41:07,"For one day it only had ep. 9 and ep 19 of the original series, which was odd. Then the next day all the original eps were gone."
2017-07-12 19:39:54,. @Shawhelp Tornado?? Yikes thank you!!
2017-07-12 19:38:59,@AB_EmergAlert TV broadcasting of AEAS still not working. @Shawhelp
2017-07-12 19:38:19,"Nope, only the new season is listed now. First two seasons are gone."
2017-07-12 19:36:07,"@Shawhelp What is the point of the Weather Alerts, if my cable signal cuts out when one is played? Even affects PVR and VOD. Makes no sense!"
2017-07-12 19:36:01,. @Shawhelp thanks! Any idea what the emergency alert was for?
2017-07-12 19:35:52,"@Shawhelp this EAS thing is annoying, it`s just a black screen. Hope it stops so my recording of defiant ones doesn`t get screwed up."
2017-07-12 19:35:35,"@Shawhelp Grr, another round of ineffective Emergency Alerts! Please make it work or stop the interruptions.(SW Calgary)"
2017-07-12 19:34:56,Another day and another Emergency Response Alert = another failed alert by @Shawhelp . Unfortunate for those in direct paths of these alerts.

2017-07-12 19:32:15,A few days later and while i'm getting a bit more visual- can not hear anything nor read the @AB_EmergAlert that just came across the tv
2017-07-12 19:32:09,Hey @Shawhelp your emergency alerts breaking into my TV shows aren't working.
2017-07-12 19:30:20,ahh man I’m screwed
2017-07-12 19:25:25,Lol...Internet providers playing god seems to be the way of the future. lol
2017-07-12 19:25:19,Sucks that @Shawhelp doesn't have HBO Canada on Free Range TV. Will be on vacation with no legal way to watch #GOT7 . #FirstWorldProblems
2017-07-12 19:24:25,Clearly Shaw doesn't want Steve or I to survive the impending doom
2017-07-12 19:24:13,@Shawhelp hi there. I had a service call booked for between 5-7. No show so far. Little help?
2017-07-12 19:23:19,Pretty sure this violates @CRTCeng policy. They knew about this problem last time there was an emergency alert.
2017-07-12 19:22:31,Worked here in #Bowness
2017-07-12 19:22:24,I saw that... haven't had an issue. /shrug.
2017-07-12 19:21:24,"I think @ShawInfo switched me over to dial-up while I was at work, @shawhelp . Wow, this is sssssssllllllooooooowwwww today."
2017-07-12 19:21:09,I know @SteveTomsYYC had this issue too the other night
2017-07-12 19:20:38,@Shawhelp What's up with the EAS again? Tornado warning then screen goes black and cuts out. Thought you fixed it on the weekend.
2017-07-12 19:19:15,"@Shawhelp I see it's Emerg Alert night again. Do you know they don't come through on Gateway, just freeze the screen? And some choppy audio"
2017-07-12 19:19:15,Weird... mine was fine in Airdrie. Wonder if it only certain types in cable packages.
2017-07-12 19:19:02,@Shawhelp Looks like the EAS notification is glitching the audio and video again. South-west Calgary.
2017-07-12 19:18:55,"@Shawhelp The @AB_EmergAlert still aren't working - sound badly cutting out, just a black screen. #abstorm #yyc #emergencyalert"

2017-07-11 22:32:35,Do you know how long the maintenance will take ?
2017-07-11 22:30:55,@Shawhelp #WinnipegOutage Where can we see outage updates from you?
2017-07-11 22:26:26,@Shawhelp internet is down in Sault Ste. Marie Ontario
2017-07-11 22:25:11,@Shawhelp #outage Winnipeg Garden Grove ETA?
2017-07-11 22:22:56,@Shawhelp Hey in Winnipeg were out in the Brookeside Area (Northwest)

2017-07-11 21:47:52,"Thanks for reaching out, even without a direct @at you Guys! Im from Germany btw, just made a little Joke! That made my Day! Thanks! (1)..."
2017-07-11 20:52:26,It has nothing to do with Apple TV did you not read what I tweeted you in photos
2017-07-11 20:45:49,"Thanks for the help, looks like everything's good!"
2017-07-11 20:36:02,@Shawhelp will you be supporting TV Provider (feature) on iOS 11 @AppleSupport pic.twitter.com/jRvT6mRiCA
2017-07-11 20:02:36,"Also intermittent spikes when connecting to FFXIV, but they're less stable than Google for verifying an issue."
2017-07-11 20:01:44,"@Shawhelp Looks like there's some network instability in Edmonton? Dropping random packets when pinging google, local network seems fine."
2017-07-11 19:52:25,@Shawhelp there was an internet issue in my area on Saturday and now the internet is down again. Can you tell me if there is another outage?
2017-07-11 19:35:47,can I direct message you for assistance?
2017-07-11 19:10:18,"@shawhelp , Shaw on demand is useless as it's episodes behind; John Oliver's Last Week Tonight for instance. Defeats the purpose."
2017-07-11 19:05:33,Will try but the amount of times wi-fi connections need redoing in general is frustrating. Smart technology is not.
2017-07-11 18:48:46,@Shawhelp Hello! Do you know of any problems with internet service tonight? Thanks - Jay
2017-07-11 18:02:23,All we need is an address (DM is recommended) and we will try to clear the bases for you.
2017-07-11 17:57:01,. @ShawDirect how about you? 101 minutes & a tech no-show. Vianet is on deck and Lakeland Networks is @bat. Hoping for some customer service pic.twitter.com/HKwYjN7Y66

2017-07-11 16:47:33,@Shawhelp we're on day 5 of the outage now with no eta on when we will get service. Can we please get an update?
2017-07-11 16:09:55,@Shawhelp Hey.....whats your disconnect number......getting gouged by Shaw so I am going with Telus! Thanks!!
2017-07-11 15:46:51,@TELUS and then proceeded to tell me that someone MIGHT come on the 14th... but it's dependent on a third party? @Shawhelp where you at babe
2017-07-11 15:29:58,@Shawhelp So looking at my options with regard to my tv and isp. Why does Shaw limit my upload on Shaw 150. Telus is 150 up and down??
2017-07-11 14:44:36,@GlobalTV_PR plz get the app global go @Shawhelp
2017-07-11 14:11:04,"@Shawhelp Shaw:""You don't have an account"" Me:""I'm logged in right now"" Shaw: ""Well you must have an account then. But we can't find it"""
2017-07-11 13:25:34,I should get on that before Sunday.
2017-07-11 12:53:49,Also i have experienced super shit service from telus...BIG TIME SHIT SERVICE FROM TELUS!!
2017-07-11 12:52:34,Caution! Telus has given me the same issue at my house ( thats y im switching to shaw today ) . Doesn't sound promising
2017-07-11 12:30:54,I would like to know if this is true or not.
2017-07-11 12:30:17,"@Shawhelp Hey, I received a call while I was at work yesterday, with someone claiming that we went over our data limit for this period."
2017-07-11 12:17:33,thanks!
2017-07-11 11:16:42,Yea the wait there was longer than last time I was at the passport office. Unexceptionable.
2017-07-11 11:08:35,@shawhelp every time I'm connected to shawpasspoint my internet hangs even with 5 bars. I have to disable wi-fi to continue. Ugh!
2017-07-11 11:00:02,"@Shawhelp help I can't log in to my Gateway from my phone, but I haven't changed the password or anything."
2017-07-11 10:54:18,Thanks. sent the DM.
2017-07-11 10:52:27,"Looks like, after years... @Shawhelp may have finally fixed my internet! Fingers crossed it stays working pic.twitter.com/E8NM6tUV3v"
2017-07-11 10:51:56,"@Shawhelp Located in Belgravia Edmonton using shaw internet, modem gets no connection, is Belgravia affected by the other outages?"
2017-07-11 10:50:29,Well at least I'm not the only frustration one in line here @Shawhelp
2017-07-11 10:47:40,@Shawhelp do your cs just show up for work late or do you understaff? pic.twitter.com/ZrT85k2vXd

2017-07-11 10:43:00,@Shawhelp any reported connection issues in south Calgary? Not even able to run speed test
2017-07-11 09:14:08,"PVR unwatchable, freezing constant, internet is so bad. No wonder they get new subs to lock in multi year contract. I'm sorry @Shawhelp"
2017-07-11 08:33:08,Internet but that seems to be working now just having trouble with outlook
2017-07-11 08:22:37,Yeah checked it all. Thought we had a good deal until you guys cut us off five times in a row AFTER MAKING OUR PAYMENTS
2017-07-11 08:18:48,@Shawhelp I am so tired of your services. They are heavily OVERPRICED and your system is outdated. Hello Telus here we come !
2017-07-11 08:03:23,Any outages today in the cowichan valley
2017-07-11 07:53:43,It's pretty much the only reason we are keeping cable right now.
2017-07-11 07:53:14,I got cable and HBO just to watch #GoT . Expensive but worth it.
2017-07-11 07:52:11,"Just called up @Shawhelp , locked in HBO. Getting close. #GoT"

2017-07-10 19:30:52,@ShawInfo @Shawhelp You guys are making it really easy to switch to Telus when my new house is built. Internet never works here
2017-07-10 19:21:39,Great response
2017-07-10 18:52:05,@Shawhelp - no internet at home. Given a service appointment in 10 days.. nice way to treat long time Shaw customers
