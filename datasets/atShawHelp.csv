2017-11-10 11:55:14,What is a DM
2017-11-10 11:51:28,"So you are saying that you can not help me and I have to go back to Telus after all these years, because they could would not help me with a problem back then!!!"
2017-11-10 11:46:23,But then I have no internet for the computer that the hitron is set next to.
2017-11-10 11:43:15,Sorry did you miss my comment that said I cant. So how am I able to get this TV hardwired??? I have been with you guys for years and need someone to help me
2017-11-10 11:35:44,How can we enable it?
2017-11-10 11:32:57,But my house is fully developed so that does not work. Why is there a internet slot in the gateway if I can't use it ?
2017-11-10 11:27:47,Yeah I guess I could be. It is the one down stairs that it in my utility box
2017-11-10 11:25:13,My Son says I should be able to get it from the Arris down stairs

2017-11-10 11:12:18,"@Shawhelp .So, my DVR keeps resetting. Has happened a couple of times this week alone. What's up?"
2017-11-10 11:00:14,Great.
2017-11-10 10:55:38,Just WiFi.
2017-11-10 10:53:00,"An ""expected results"" indicator in your speed tester wouldn't hurt."
2017-11-10 10:51:22,@Shawhelp my internet keeps dropping every few minutes. Is there some work being done? I've already reset the modem.
2017-11-10 10:42:37,"2 up, 4.5 down. I've been getting dropoffs as well. A reset of my modem seems to have dealt with the problem, as I'm not getting those bad results anymore, but I can't be certain of anything."
2017-11-10 10:35:17,"Troubleshooting requires knowing the cause, and I have no way to know what that is."
2017-11-10 10:30:30,@Shawhelp Saying my speed test results are lower than expected means nothing when you won't tell me WHY it's too low.
2017-11-10 10:24:05,@Shawhelp guess I'm going to @TELUS . Customer loyalty at Shaw means milk the cash cow
2017-11-10 10:20:19,"So can this impact the overall speed available to me? If there are enough Freedom users connected will I see an overall speed slowdown, wired and WiFi?"

2017-11-09 20:14:34,"@Shawhelp Incredibly disappointed today after a second visit from your cable technician and still no cable. This time though, he cut our internet cable.

2017-11-09 20:07:50,"It changes so fast, 4, 5, & 6 were lowest for a minute. I did manage to get speed up on channel 4, hoping not have to do this again for a while. Thank you 4 ur help!!!"

2017-11-09 19:48:59,Got it up to 14mbps with fresh re-boot. Will look at channels next. As an aside I am doing this alot more than I use to - not really satisfied with Shaw!
2017-11-09 19:41:49,@Shawhelp Shaw needs to get their shit together I swear if my internet goes down once more before a midterm or essay
2017-11-09 19:41:47,Thanks for your help. Your suggestions worked.
2017-11-09 19:37:47,All is says is to re-boot. I've done that so many times already. I get 20mbps but 5 or 7 at $85/month?
2017-11-09 19:34:48,This happens alot! Here's your speed test pic.twitter.com/BF4Jw5yfAq
2017-11-09 19:32:14,No connection to internet with an Ethernet cable from the modem
2017-11-09 19:26:35,@shawhelp why is my wifi signal only providing less than 5% of the 25mbps speed that I am paying for? pic.twitter.com/OVybaNa0c6

2017-11-09 19:11:30,Will do. My downstairs tv works fine. Just the box upstairs having issues.

2017-11-09 19:08:14,@Shawhelp is the internet having issues in Sault Ste Marie?
2017-11-09 19:04:38,Talking to my TV is great but if it doesn't respond it doesn't matter. It's like having a teenager.
2017-11-09 19:02:56,We have had this issue several times in the last few weeks. It tells us to reset it. We try it and it takes several attempts but finally does reset. I like my old Shaw cable better.
2017-11-09 19:01:14,It tells me it is having issues connecting to the portal. I can continue watching the current program but not change channels or bring up the guide.
2017-11-09 18:56:55,@Shawhelp So everytime it snows or rains is my Shaw Bluesky going to not work properly??? Just curious.
2017-11-09 18:45:40,And the cable companies wonder why people are going to streaming. Show something we want.
2017-11-09 18:37:37,"Yea i called 220 bucks and i lost a month.There should be at least some game on! We live in canada, a hockey country! with many games on again and no access to any is pretty sad!"

2017-11-09 18:15:10,"@Shawhelp I can’t get an Internet connection tonight,the DS light keeps flashing on my modem. I tried the coaxial cable at the back already"
2017-11-09 18:11:52,"Nope, they aren't. Top one is sold, second and last light are flashing. I've also tried rebooting several times."
2017-11-09 18:08:26,"@Shawhelp does Thunder Bay, Ontario have an outage for Internet?"
2017-11-09 17:47:55,Good evening. This gentleman may not be a customer. He is referring to a next door neighbour and a cable across his driveway that Shaw laid so it would be the cable team.
2017-11-09 16:44:19,Internet for the first time didn't drop as well... still very obviously slow service in that department too... been a frustrating few months with y'all
2017-11-09 16:40:06,I unplugged it and it reset.... it just sucks that we have had to do this so often! We haven't even been compensated for all the issues we've encountered! Is that up to us to make you offer something?!
2017-11-09 16:31:27,@Shawhelp ??? Just documenting another glitch... pretty laughable now that we stay on as a customer pic.twitter.com/yVRj9wlQCk
2017-11-09 15:37:27,yes agreed. And this is a recent occurrence. I've been able to connect recently to hotspots here.
2017-11-09 15:31:14,I will see if it works at another hotspot. The problem seems to be that this hotspot is not asking/prompting for user info. Can't even change the config to enter it.
2017-11-09 15:25:33,"Galaxy s6. And yes, I've done ""forget network"" several times."
2017-11-09 15:20:31,"yes I can see ShawOpen but cannot connect. Says Authentication error, even though I haven't entered and can't enter my uid/pwd info."
2017-11-09 15:10:10,@Shawhelp currently having an issue with connecting to ShawOpen. Are there known problems in Nanaimo?
2017-11-09 15:07:03,@Shawhelp Troy in Winnipeg took my Shaw internet help phone call. He fixed the problem like a boss in seconds flat. He hardly said a word. Thanks Troy. #wificall

2017-11-08 22:05:55,@Shawhelp why isn't BBC World News in HD on Shaw? You barely have any HD channels. Have you seen Telus? 2x the number of HD channels compared to you. Don't make me switch to them.

2017-11-06 19:37:58,Thanks for email from SVP and cust serv response to the issue. Glitches happen to all companies... your response was great.
2017-11-06 18:56:53,Same time. Not always the same two series. Usually second show will error out. If we don’t catch the message (TV off) we lose the show.
2017-11-06 18:52:00,@Shawhelp fix you’re shit I’m sick of my internet crashing !!!
2017-11-06 18:46:06,Yeah. It was down for 90 minutes. It was just bad timing but the new rig is up and running

2017-11-05 15:36:42,@Shawhelp your employees cutting people off doesn’t seem like professional practice. License plate KV 3650 at 2:25 today
2017-11-05 15:17:58,Yes we are! Is there an expected time for it to be back up?
2017-11-05 15:13:12,No internet here too! (West Edmonton)

2017-11-05 14:17:20,I just checked on Shaw.ca and it appears that it is possible to order a brand new Gateway via online order for $348. Is that still true?
2017-11-05 14:12:43,"Okay, I will tell them, thanks. Is it possible to order a new Gateway from Shaw? She said she phoned Shaw and was referred to BestBuy."
2017-11-05 14:07:03,Interesting. So it would be pretty risky ordering online from BestBuy then? No indication of previous years of use. Says check with Shaw
2017-11-05 14:02:54,Apparently it's blacked out in BC. Silly NHL. Thanks for your help!
2017-11-05 14:00:15,"Excellent! Ps. If they buy the refurbished Gateway from Best Buy, what is the warranty? BestBuy said the warranty is with Shaw."
2017-11-05 14:00:06,Is it possible to watch on a laptop then? Or no?
2017-11-05 13:55:43,They don't care if they are interconnected. Just want to add a 3rd PVR to their setup without losing their other PVRs and the recorded shows
2017-11-05 13:54:45,I am asking for a friend. They have one Pace and one Motorola PVR I believe. They simply want to add a TV to their house with a Gateway pvr
2017-11-05 13:46:28,"@Shawhelp If you buy a new Shaw Gateway Box, can you just add it to a new TV and keep using your existing PVRs and all their recordings?"
2017-11-05 13:34:02,Hi my internet's been down all day. Any eta on when it'll be back up?
2017-11-05 13:18:06,@Shawhelp thanks Lance for the update. Hopefully it's fixed soon. Cheers

2017-11-05 12:39:57,Yes. Even checked tomorrow's listings. All there. The white swirl instead of series record is on all pre-sets. Fixd one but not the others.
2017-11-05 12:36:14,@Shawhelp are there issues in Sault Ste Marie?
2017-11-05 12:29:08,Seems to be okay today.. Just not the most fun when you're trying to do updates ;)

2017-11-05 12:16:47,Happy. Took a few minutes to get back the TV listings. Recordings are back. Not my pre-set to record. Still have a white swirl.

2017-11-05 11:46:15,"@Shawhelp Help! PVR changed time at 1 am, shut off, came back on. Now it says no pre-set recordings, no recordings & used space is used."
2017-11-05 11:21:11,Im sure you guys can. I pay you 200+ a month for service. It is the least you can do...
2017-11-05 11:17:11,I would like to have a month to preview it.

2017-11-04 23:01:29,wifi was terrible! all night!
2017-11-04 22:57:37,"@Shawhelp wow, way to drop the ball on arguably one of the best UFC cards on the past 5 years."
2017-11-04 22:56:04,Too late! We figured something else out #refund
2017-11-04 22:53:57,Accidentally started a ppv. Some ufc fight. Did not watch. What do I do?
2017-11-04 22:53:20,"@Shawhelp sure hope I don't get charged for the ufc tonight, missed the whole show"
2017-11-04 22:50:38,Any chance I'll get a refund. Had to cab it to the bar. Missed the first 90 min
2017-11-04 22:49:41,"Nope, not working."
2017-11-04 22:42:00,Thanks @Shawhelp ...missed the finish.
2017-11-04 22:38:30,"I’m not on blue sky, just have a black screen. Help."

2017-11-04 22:29:00,@Shawhelp payed for the UFC fight tonight and as soon as the main card begins... black screen. #pissed
2017-11-04 22:24:14,"2 hours and 20 mins and it just came on, the last frickin fight! Wow @ShawInfo @shawhelp you better not charge us!"
2017-11-04 22:23:41,I have blue sky but I already paid for it when I ordered it. Will I get a refund? This has been a mess. I had a bunch of friends over for it
2017-11-04 22:23:34,"All good, started working awhile ago now but thank you"
2017-11-04 22:20:39,Brutal
2017-11-04 22:19:41,"what a joke of service ""we will credit you the fight"" well obviously you are not going to charge for a fight I didn't get @Shawhelp"
2017-11-04 22:18:53,So ooooooo... Still working on it?
2017-11-04 22:18:25,@Shawhelp my order of the ufc pay per view just froze before the main event.
2017-11-04 22:17:30,How long???
2017-11-04 22:16:43,@Shawhelp thanks for freezing & making me miss GSP's walk in!!!
2017-11-04 22:16:30,Kinda late I think. I suspect you won't be charging me.
2017-11-04 22:14:10,I will like to have a refund on my account.
2017-11-04 22:09:46,@Shawhelp how are you going to make this right? Customers wanted to and couldn't watch UFC 217!!
2017-11-04 22:09:24,@Shawhelp how come at least 3 times a day it says connection error contact shaw then a minute later the channel comes back
2017-11-04 22:09:17,"All good, problem resolved"
2017-11-04 22:06:16,@shawhelp any idea whats going on? I've replaced my splitter and coax. This is on 150 Package from New Westminster http:// shaw.speedtestcustom.com/result/47a55ed 0-c1de-11e7-b0f9-e7227c8578af …
2017-11-04 22:01:40,1/2.
2017-11-04 21:57:05,Uhhh @Shawhelp I think I just let you know. Give me a * #to a manager and we'll talk - as will all the other people gathered in my basement
2017-11-04 21:53:59,UNACCEPTABLE. Unless you can drastically lower our bills and FULL REFUND expect myself as well as im sure many others to switch to TELUS.
2017-11-04 21:48:58,Too late
2017-11-04 21:48:58,@shawhelp The main event on TSN is over. Can I have the UFC fight yet?
2017-11-04 21:45:40,@Shawhelp we're going to miss the fight aren't we? What's going on! pic.twitter.com/adDB5H4Myq
2017-11-04 21:44:39,Working on a fix lol? Its almost over. #youhadonejob
2017-11-04 21:42:56,How can we still not see the fights? We also got hung up by CS. Phone number 604 308 4698
2017-11-04 21:39:26,Btw it's not just blue sky customers
2017-11-04 21:39:17,"Waste of time. Your ""investigation"" took an hour. Just had to charge on my iPhone instead. Better not be charged."
2017-11-04 21:38:34,@Shawhelp is there even a timeline? Cause it would be nice to know if I should order on the internet or wait until it is fixed.
2017-11-04 21:38:14,@Shawhelp missing the fights . hour later. pic.twitter.com/Vjd3lAWJdY
2017-11-04 21:37:42,"@Shawhelp dude, I'm trying to watch the GSP fight and your Bluebox is lights out. #YourePayinForThis #ShawMoreLikeNaw"
2017-11-04 21:36:24,No it says it’s have issues tuning to channel and something about my account.
2017-11-04 21:36:18,Yes just a loading screen on channel 601. Employee account....
2017-11-04 21:36:01,"Hey Shaw, absolutely NO EXCUSES FOR THIS ONE! For the $$$ you charge monthly you guys can't get a ppv going? Get your shit together!!! pic.twitter.com/Ub2oDuv5l1"
2017-11-04 21:35:53,a little late dont you think? Blusky bs. $170 a month and missed the ppv how do you make this up to me for my inconvevience.
2017-11-04 21:34:51,WHEN WILL THIS BE FIXED
2017-11-04 21:34:21,@Shawhelp I am one of the Blue Sky people that can’t get the fight. “on hold” guy is telling me to go to 300 or 324 - I don’t have those
2017-11-04 21:33:51,We have a house full of people too and no UFC! What the hell! Had to pay a sitter and Shaw won’t pay me back for that!!
2017-11-04 21:33:38,"@Shawhelp don't worry Shaw, we ordered through IOS. Better not be showing on our bill. Took an hour for an ""investigation"" still no resolve."
2017-11-04 21:32:35,Thanks but we called in and they said it was some back end issue affecting it for a majority of customers.
2017-11-04 21:31:42,It’s not some customer it’s everyone on your blueskytv!!! @ShawInfo @shawhelp
2017-11-04 21:30:47,"@Shawhelp @Telus Hey Telus, hit me up, I need a new provider."
2017-11-04 21:30:36,On bluesky as well and not working. Cancelled it and just found a stream instead
2017-11-04 21:30:35,@shawhelp To Everyone looking for a refund. You have to contact THEM within 24-48 hours to get refund. They are not just giving us one.
2017-11-04 21:30:01,It’s been an hour and a half and still nothing! Come on @shawhelp
2017-11-04 21:26:55,@Shawhelp Hilarious! No UFC pay-per-view but Shaw just delivered my bill for the month. Thanks! So I guess billing works. #Disappointed
2017-11-04 21:26:26,@Shawhelp #FuckShaw
2017-11-04 21:25:41,@Shawhelp what's going on? This is stupid we paid for this
2017-11-04 21:25:26,"He already got it working with your help, about 40 minutes ago. Thanks!"
2017-11-04 21:25:23,@Shawhelp Shaw chat wait is 31 hours.....hmmmmmm. You guys are a piece of SHIT!!!! Fuck You!
2017-11-04 21:24:18,To think we just switched to BlueSkyTV then this?? Seriously epic fail @shaw
2017-11-04 21:21:32,@Shawhelp what is happening with our ufc tonight
2017-11-04 21:20:51,Blue Sky? More like Blue Cry.
2017-11-04 21:20:38,"@Shawhelp So, is a fix on the way for #ufc217 ? I ordered it yesterday no problem, but am now seeing black."
2017-11-04 21:19:13,@Shawhelp any word on when the fix will be?
2017-11-04 21:18:40,"Okay, I've Got A Bunch Of Very Unhappy People Here... Uncluding Myself... Hopefully Something Is Done, If This Isn't Resolved.."
2017-11-04 21:18:18,Just got Blue Sky to not watch UFC 217. Great job.
2017-11-04 21:17:50,@Shawhelp at this point you should be giving it away for free. This is ridiculous
2017-11-04 21:16:28,@Shawhelp Brutal pay-per-view service w/ Shaw tonight for UFC12. 8 people over. Custom UFC belt up for grabs. NO FEED! #Disappointed pic.twitter.com/JMLy1U7J9C
2017-11-04 21:15:02,@Shawhelp Found a fix guys. Cancel Shaw services order @TELUS services
2017-11-04 21:13:27,We gave up and ordered it online. No patience for poor service when it's an event like this.
2017-11-04 21:11:47,We have a house full of people here. No PPV. This is fun. Thanks for ruining the night Shaw.

2017-11-04 21:09:38,Great!!! So we basically can't watch a fight we paid for? No issues with the last ppv we ordered so what changed ???
2017-11-04 21:09:03,Will you replay it for all of us that are missing it!!!
2017-11-04 21:08:50,So we are getting it for free then??
2017-11-04 21:08:41,Shaw support chat just decided to disconnect on me after sending me a link to the support page...that's fun.
2017-11-04 21:08:41,Blue sky always f’s up —
2017-11-04 21:08:32,@Shawhelp I sent a direct message. Just wanted to make sure I’m not getting charged for the UFC fight as I can’t access it
2017-11-04 21:08:03,@Shawhelp start streaming it for us to watch
2017-11-04 21:07:15,Blue sky is the worst provider I’ve ever had. So disappointed and can’t wait to get out of my contract
2017-11-04 21:06:58,Is there any hope it will be on before the end of the fights? I'm still expecting a full refund either way
2017-11-04 21:06:37,Not a good start to our “new” BlueSky experience!
2017-11-04 21:06:37,Please check your dm
2017-11-04 21:06:13,@Shawhelp Same issues here. Bluesky not getting a signal even though order was confirmed
2017-11-04 21:06:13,Did you try turning it off and turning it back on?
2017-11-04 21:06:05,I have a feeling we are all on blue sky—
2017-11-04 21:05:48,@shawhelp will be shopping at telus tomorrow. #sad . You wont even reply to a blusky customer or answer your phones
2017-11-04 21:05:26,"There better not be any charges on my bill.... Your crap gateway and internet act up constantly, getting charged will be it for me."
2017-11-04 21:05:23,Please check your dm i have supplied my account njmber
2017-11-04 21:05:01,@Shawhelp still waiting for answer here..... waste of my money.
2017-11-04 21:04:43,Is that why I’ve been on hold for 65 min?
2017-11-04 21:04:38,@Shawhelp Can you please help me access the GSP fight? Getting black screen. Thanks!
2017-11-04 21:04:26,We better not have to pay for this... already missed an hour of the fights
2017-11-04 21:04:23,And everyone here knows it’s gonna take 4-6 months to fight them to take the charges off
2017-11-04 21:04:16,I guess you don’t reply to people that have already dmd you?
2017-11-04 21:04:01,If it comes on i want half off

2017-11-04 21:03:38,@Shawhelp HOW DO YOU GUYS LET THIS HAPPEN WITH YOUR PAPER VIEWS!?!?!? THIS IS NOT A GOOD LOOK!!
2017-11-04 21:03:22,No point in waiting anymore! Let me know if there will be refunds.
2017-11-04 21:02:26,There's no order button anymore. We've tried everything and after an hour on hold we hung up. Read that Shaw is telling people to just wait
2017-11-04 21:02:18,Still not working! Tried everything!
2017-11-04 21:01:09,I've given up on shaw and ordered on iOS. I'll be expecting a refund if I see a charge on my bill.
2017-11-04 21:01:07,"So, full refunds for this disaster? This is embarrassing."
2017-11-04 21:00:57,It better not be on the bill...

2017-11-02 19:22:09,I use Shaw and they are a cut above. They even reply on twitter.
2017-11-02 19:18:11,@Shawhelp haven't had my cordless phone connected when I plug it in it says no line. Also no tv as it says no gateway portal. Assistance?
2017-11-02 19:05:15,Hello Phedra-Lyn ! Looks like your signal is cutting out due to accumulated snow on the dish. Plz DM us for more info on fixing this. :) *ml
2017-11-02 19:00:18,@Shawhelp is it possible to fast toward through commercials/30 seconds at a time w blue sky? Also there's no stop button is there?
2017-11-02 18:54:19,I didn’t want to make changes I wanted to watch the game on the channel I get as planned. Should have given free SN360 last eve
2017-11-02 18:48:05,I’m on the way home now. My wife texted me about the internet. I’ll check tv when I get there.
2017-11-02 18:45:09,We have cable. I’m concerned because I adjusted my tv options today and the agent was less than helpful.
2017-11-02 18:41:36,@Shawhelp is there an internet outage for the Killarney area of Vancouver?
2017-11-02 18:19:28,@Shawhelp we haven’t even had the call back option. Please let me know. We have urgent questions. Thanks
2017-11-02 18:08:20,@Shawhelp the shows I pvr’d are either not New like it states or the wrong show altogether
2017-11-02 17:57:55,"@Shawhelp What’s up with the onscreen listings for BBC Earth, they’ve been a mess for days."
2017-11-02 17:55:50,"I'm switching to Telus, should have a long time ago. You treat your long term customers like garbage!"
2017-11-02 16:50:42,@Shawhelp is there an internet outage in cloverdale. My internet is out
2017-11-02 15:05:50,"@Shawhelp Do you know why I would suddenly have a problem today signing in to my Shaw on Demand app? It's making me sign in, then tells me I don't have access to the service. But I can still access my On Demand stuff on the TV as usual."
2017-11-02 14:05:18,@Shawhelp any reason why cable and internet would be down in Surrey bc right now?
2017-11-02 13:34:29,@Shawhelp Hi we have noticed a lot of static on our home phones lately. Is there anything that we can try try to clear this up?
2017-11-02 12:44:35,Thank you
2017-11-02 12:34:35,"@Shawhelp internet and cable out in Grandin area of St.Albert, AB. Is this a known outage?"
2017-11-02 12:23:09,@Shawhelp why is my internet keep cutting out at random times. You guys just did maintenance and ever since my wifi sucks... thanks
2017-11-02 12:13:44,@shawhelp no sound on Shaw 83 NBC - sound is fine on all other channels
2017-11-02 12:06:30,"@Shawhelp our internet is down for 3rd time today. We're trying to work, what is going on?"
2017-11-02 11:49:19,Wife fixed it. Just needed to reset gateway bix. Thanks Phil!
2017-11-02 11:40:09,Thanks...my wife is calling in. Im at work so Ill let her handle it. Was just curious if it was systematic or just isolated.
2017-11-02 11:30:48,@Shawhelp Is there a problem with the cable in Britnell NE Edmonton? Havent had cable signal all day.
2017-11-02 11:15:49,@Shawhelp Internet really slow in Sth Surrey right now. Paying for 150 but only get 67 w/ direct link to modem. Traffic? weather? aliens?
2017-11-02 10:07:37,"Also experiencing no service in Citadel, Calgary"
2017-11-02 10:00:54,And also no phone service
2017-11-02 09:59:24,Also in Citadel and have no internet or tv services
2017-11-02 09:55:04,Telus had it!!!
2017-11-02 09:54:50,"@Shawhelp hi, Citadel, Calgary #YYC resident here... Just lost all your services... Is there an area outage?"
2017-11-02 09:53:52,Why black it out. Thought you had a licence to broadcast????
2017-11-02 08:34:42,download is at 4 where it should be 20?? It's been like this forever I'm getting jipped. It's a game on my ps4.
2017-11-02 08:30:31,@Shawhelp Why the hell does it take 17hrs to download a 50gb file huh? I've tried to get assistance dozens of times but no change hello?????
2017-11-02 08:10:16,Thanks!
2017-11-02 06:50:46,@Shawhelp when will the fireplace channel make an appearance?
2017-11-02 01:27:42,"@Shawhelp DS light is off, US light is flashing on modem. Tried unplugging power, coax and using reset button. Is it something on your end?"
2017-11-01 23:38:02,@Shawhelp is your server down? I'm in the Winnipeg maples area and the modem seemed to have just stopped sending ping.
2017-11-01 22:26:32,Feels bad when shaw gets blamed for the nhl's blackout restrictions
2017-11-01 22:19:01,Or a problem with the TV or PVR for the same reasons.
2017-11-01 22:18:30,I honestly don't think it's the signal. I do not think I've ever seen this issue on CBC. It doesn't happen with any other show or sport.
2017-11-01 22:13:19,It only seems to be Sportsnet related. I'll wait until a game is on both CBC and a SN and see if I can't determine if it's the channel.
2017-11-01 22:07:00,Doesn’t help one bit when you thought you recorded Canucks game on sportnet and then find out you have recorded the World Series twice#telus
2017-11-01 22:05:35,"Also, despite my having done nothing to the cable or the TV it seems to have ceased doing it."
2017-11-01 22:04:55,"Funnily enough, we do not have any other boxes in the house, not sure why you always think we do."
2017-11-01 21:54:02,Unfortunately the PVR is suffering anyway and cannot be relied on to show even the non jerky play reliably.
2017-11-01 21:53:24,"It happens all over the ice, but is reasonably guaranteed to happen each time the play crosses through the neutral zone."
2017-11-01 21:46:04,@Shawhelp I just got my bill for the month and it says I ordered a UFC event that I never watched. Why would I order a month old event?
2017-11-01 21:41:12,Each of the first 3 or 4 times I've brought it up with you all. It happens just too often at the same spots on the ice to be the connection
2017-11-01 21:35:41,"...speed and cuts frames or something, but I have no setting like that set. I'm fairly sure that it gets sent by you or Sportsnet this way."
2017-11-01 21:34:27,It's nothing to do with that. The TV has no other signal problems on any other channels. It is possible that the TV can't handle...cont...
2017-11-01 21:28:16,@Shawhelp . You must be part of the a government sector. Cause you don’t do anything and charge me $250/month. I hate u!
2017-11-01 21:22:28,@Shawhelp the Canucks game on 302 is doing that jerky movement thing that I've been complaining about.
2017-11-01 21:20:47,You people are Stellar and Wonderful TYVM
2017-11-01 21:10:41,"Ok it is what it is, sorry for being snarky I love my Canucks!"
2017-11-01 21:03:31,Just a notice of blackout restrictions. No need to show Leafs on multiple channels and screw Canuck fans. #comeonman
2017-11-01 21:01:37,Way to go Shaw you screwed us again. I PVRd the wrong game thanks to you. Why do you keep doing this? Get your act together
2017-11-01 20:57:26,@Shawhelp I just got CraveTV thru Shaw. Can I access it on my laptop when not at home?
2017-11-01 20:56:58,"That's ridiculous! My on tv guide shows the game on Sportsnet 360. Multiple channels showing Leafs game, so that's B.S."
2017-11-01 20:52:12,In the past when there was schedule issues they put the game on PPV channel
2017-11-01 20:49:53,Looking for this game in Sask. Not necessary to show the damn Leafs on multiple channels is it? Where is the Canucks game I paid for?
2017-11-01 20:47:05,Unacceptable! You’ve screwed us again Shaw. Shame on you.
2017-11-01 20:45:32,I'm a huge #Devils fan and this is completely unacceptable. Why am I paying for it??
2017-11-01 20:45:15,nope
2017-11-01 20:44:04,I experience this multiple times a year and it gets old really quick. Blackouts are complete crap
2017-11-01 20:43:09,So I had plans and people over to watch the game that was advertised. This crap is why people don't pay for cable anymore
2017-11-01 20:39:47,@Shawhelp complete bullshit advertising games on subscribed channels then changing programming and blacking out other options for game
2017-11-01 20:38:59,So I need to move to B.C. to watch the Devils play? Ok...
2017-11-01 20:34:41,Then make 360 free tonight. Simple fix.
2017-11-01 20:33:04,Are you serious?
2017-11-01 20:32:59,"Hey @Shawhelp , your guide info is wrong. Game is listed on incorrect channels. I Found it on 302 because of this tweet."
2017-11-01 20:32:26,Please read back my tweets and you might understand my frustration.
2017-11-01 20:30:49,World series is on multiple channels already. Wwwhhhyyy bump the oilers??
2017-11-01 20:30:33,"I know it’s not your call, but that’s SO dumb."
2017-11-01 20:28:31,This is all I’m getting pic.twitter.com/bMAb3UueJt
2017-11-01 20:25:12,HEY! 302 & 326 is dead air! I live in AB and paid for Centre Ice to watch the Canucks. Wasn’t an issue vs Dallas Monday. Fix this now.
2017-11-01 20:22:42,Canucks/Devils.
2017-11-01 20:20:18,Sent you a PM but found it on 328. Thanks! :)
2017-11-01 20:20:15,I ended up on mango tv
2017-11-01 20:16:32,"So... the game won't be shown on Sportnet, which I pay for, nor the NHL cable package, which I also pay for? Nice."
2017-11-01 20:16:22,302 and 326 are both blank in Edmonton saying Not Subscribed (I do have the ice pack).
2017-11-01 20:16:16,Liars. Where the hell is the Oilers game???
2017-11-01 20:15:11,302 tells me I'm not subscribed to that channel.
2017-11-01 20:15:03,360 should be enabled on a free preview then for tonight in Alberta
2017-11-01 20:15:02,It's on 328
2017-11-01 20:14:42,How uninformed are you? It's on SN360. Guide says Devils vs Canucks and no subscription necessary. I give up. @shawnohelp
2017-11-01 20:14:12,Tried all of them and nada.
2017-11-01 20:13:57,Thank you
2017-11-01 20:13:08,I'm in Manitoba... nothing but dead air on both 302 and 326.
2017-11-01 20:12:54,Thanks! We were floundering!!
2017-11-01 20:12:18,@Shawhelp where is the Canucks game? Says Canucks vs Devils and the Oilers game is on pic.twitter.com/i1nOUCYxWz
2017-11-01 20:12:00,@Shawhelp guide says it on 223 but Baseball game is on. So because sportsnet changed things I'm out of luck?
2017-11-01 20:10:16,Where’s the Canucks game? It was supposed to be on 360!
2017-11-01 20:08:47,What about the Devils/Canucks?
2017-11-01 20:08:28,U people had this so screwed up this evening. Time to look at an alternative provider. Fed up with inaccurate guides. And I PAY ENOUGH!
2017-11-01 20:04:47,blank screen. :(
2017-11-01 20:04:34,"Don't have 302 and it says I have to subscribe for 326. I've been able to watch it on 326 before without a problem. ""Info"" just gives me a"
2017-11-01 20:04:15,I’ll give it a try later tonight. Thanks!
2017-11-01 20:01:57,"It’s super weird. We even reset the modem and router and can only get the 5GZ working. Oh well, at least one does!"
2017-11-01 19:53:04,Can I get a follow for dm’s
2017-11-01 19:50:38,So how do I get 360?
2017-11-01 19:49:27,@Shawhelp Not everyone wants to give you more money for less and less - Oilers game on SN360 that I don't want to pay for. Boo Shaw!
2017-11-01 19:47:42,Thanks mate!
2017-11-01 19:47:01,You guys suck! Who cares about a baseball game between 2 teams thousands of miles away.
2017-11-01 19:45:56,@Shawhelp any help getting the oilers game tonight? I have sports net but can’t find the game anywhere
2017-11-01 19:44:53,You're right
2017-11-01 19:44:49,Jk
2017-11-01 19:44:36,I guess we'll fine out in 15 minutes
2017-11-01 19:41:17,pic.twitter.com/4XWO8l1ppu
2017-11-01 19:41:01,Is there any other way to watch it other way than to pay for it? I'm quite annoyed that they are prioritizing poker and baseball over hockey
2017-11-01 19:40:27,+A to @Shawhelp great customer service
2017-11-01 19:35:08,anything now? I'd like to get this fixed
2017-11-01 19:34:57,I got it back by connecting to my 5Ghz connection. Maybe just too much interference tonight.
2017-11-01 19:34:24,Sent!
2017-11-01 19:33:52,Frustrating
2017-11-01 19:33:36,Shaw should turn on SN 360 for all Edmonton customers for the game?
2017-11-01 19:30:26,not sure why I have sent it twice and I don;t' really want to put all my private information on here
2017-11-01 19:29:55,But you could @Sportsnet that your client base is less than happy!
2017-11-01 19:29:03,Same issue as everyone else here. What an absolute joke.
2017-11-01 19:27:17,@Shawhelp are you heading of any outages downtown Calgary? No internet here.
2017-11-01 19:25:17,that's crooked. Just stop fishing for money as a company and fix it.
2017-11-01 19:24:16,"@Shawhelp Thank you, Shaw. The non-functioning wi-fi near Starbucks, Broadmead Mall, Victoria, is now fixed!!! I can tweet again!"
2017-11-01 19:24:07,sent
2017-11-01 19:24:06,Thats great for people who have shaw360... however i don't..
2017-11-01 19:24:03,"I see that, but you want extra money for that channel. SO, I don’t have it !That is what is BS"
2017-11-01 19:23:43,Disappointed-don't have SN360-premium.The #EDMvsPIT game was listed as being on my basic service-SN1. Listening on @630CHED -gr8 announcers
2017-11-01 19:23:27,How can you make a god that is Nate Coehoorn dm you for help?!? Just give the man his SN360!!
2017-11-01 19:22:19,"I don’t subscribe to this channel, so now I can’t watch it? Ridiculous. SN360 never has Oilers games on it. @Shawhelp @Sportsnet"
2017-11-01 19:20:00,"Also others are able to get the game in SD on 121 without subscription, but we don't."
2017-11-01 19:19:16,Still doesn't make sense they're showing plays of the month over current gameplay on Sportsnet One.
2017-11-01 19:14:45,@Shawhelp what channel is the pens oilers game?? It's all baseball
2017-11-01 19:14:07,"When channels r sampled for subscription it’s free for a wknd, can this work for the game? Will it be replayed?"
2017-11-01 19:14:02,@Shawhelp why is the TV guide saying that the @EdmontonOilers are playing on sportsnet1 yet there a poker game on??
2017-11-01 19:13:26,"@Shawhelp I have no phone service, my phone says check tel line, whats up?"
2017-11-01 19:13:25,This is BS. meanwhile I can watch plays if the month??? WTF.
2017-11-01 19:13:08,"Ok, thanks"
2017-11-01 19:11:39,Best two players in the league being bumped off the cable feeds onto a subscription only channel.
2017-11-01 19:07:14,It's listed on channel 159 sportsnet1 @RogersHelps you've angered many of hockey fans
2017-11-01 19:04:39,That is garbage... put the premiere game of the week on a premium channel. Guess this is why I'm cutting the cord.
2017-11-01 19:04:36,@Shawhelp if you don't fix the oilers game on shaw your about to lose 1million peoples business...
2017-11-01 19:02:28,You do realize that it's Crosby vs McDavid and that that's more important than poker and baseball to the majority of Canadians right?
2017-11-01 19:02:14,@Shawhelp so you guys moved the oilers game to a channel I’m not subscribed to. Not happy and I think I’m done with Shaw.
2017-11-01 19:00:58,How do you guys not have the hockey game available in HD?
2017-11-01 19:00:01,No difference.
2017-11-01 18:56:18,Bullshit!!
2017-11-01 18:55:28,@Shawhelp @Sportsnet What channel is the Oilers game on tonight? All of the channels that list Oilers Vs Pens have poker or the World Series
2017-11-01 18:52:34,It's not there. Just bars. And there's no blackout as it's in SNW ON REG CABLE. This is not satisfactory as I pay for Free range.
2017-11-01 18:51:36,Thanks!
2017-11-01 18:50:49,@Shawhelp https:// twitter.com/jaycole1977/st atus/925887701772935168 …
2017-11-01 18:49:12,REPEAT. WHERE IS IT ON FREE RANGE???
2017-11-01 18:48:18,"My cable guide is wrong. Trying to find the Oilers game, and every channel it says it should be on is just baseball."
2017-11-01 18:47:51,"@Shawhelp so I know the oilers game is on SN360, but I don't have those channels! Will the game be on the normal channels after poker?"
2017-11-01 18:46:30,Thx!
2017-11-01 18:46:28,I finally found it on 121 which is listed poker!! Baseball is on the xhannels@listed for hockey
2017-11-01 18:46:11,@Shawhelp I don’t get 360 it’s in a different package. When I signed up I was told I would get all the oiler games...
2017-11-01 18:45:41,@Shawhelp @EdmontonOilers hey where's the @OilersNation game on SHAW
2017-11-01 18:45:36,I don’t have a channel 231. I have hockey central and whole@package but that channel is not on my listings
2017-11-01 18:42:40,"Found it, thanks!"
2017-11-01 18:41:37,@Shawhelp what channel is Sportsnet 360 in Edmonton?
2017-11-01 18:37:57,@Shawhelp where is the oilers game #oil country
2017-11-01 18:36:46,@Shawhelp It says Pittsburgh vs Oilers on two @Sportsnet channels. No Oilers game. I'm watching baseball and poker. What gives?
2017-11-01 18:32:12,"Three channels showed it listed... SNW, SN1 and SN360 per guide"
2017-11-01 18:28:12,@Shawhelp @EdmontonOilers which channel is the game actually on? #oilers #notbaseball
2017-11-01 18:07:30,@Shawhelp On cable u have @oilers @Sportsnet West. On Free range World Series is on that channel and oilers nowhere? Clarify?
2017-11-01 18:07:10,"Well the guide is wrong, particularly the Sportsnet channels"
2017-11-01 18:03:16,"@Shawhelp I know you have the website but I don't even know where to start with all the errors on my guide, particularly Sportsnet"
2017-11-01 17:56:37,You're a beaut! Thanks
2017-11-01 17:55:33,great and thnx.
2017-11-01 17:52:02,@Shawhelp what channel is the Canucks game on (Ladysmith)?
2017-11-01 17:43:37,At least I get a reply from you. Form Sportsnet though? Effen crickets
2017-11-01 17:38:52,Inconvenience? I have to miss one of the biggest games in the NHL this season because of MLB. Why can’t the MLB game be on360? Jerk move!
2017-11-01 17:25:16,I went home for supper and back to work. Ran out of time
2017-11-01 17:25:10,Yeah thnx I know that. Glad you finally got the memo.
2017-11-01 17:24:18,Last minute? The game has been scheduled for months lol
2017-11-01 17:20:09,I’m not home. What do you think setting recordings are for?
2017-11-01 17:11:29,"Well that’s just perfect, I can’t set my recording now. Thanks for that!"
2017-11-01 17:07:07,@Shawhelp internet just got disconnected. Doesn’t seem to work. Saskatoon east side area. Plz help. Thanks.
2017-11-01 17:04:44,I have Bluesky. Those channels don’t make sense. It doesn’t even show
2017-11-01 16:58:06,@Shawhelp set a recording for the oilers game on SNETW. The schedule is still there but the guide showing the baseball game. WTF?!
2017-11-01 16:31:36,"Everything works great, thanks guys!"
2017-11-01 16:25:42,Just sent a simple message to see if u get it now

2017-10-31 13:45:18,They said they’ll message him back. It’s frustrating
2017-10-31 13:12:54,"@Shawhelp Internet has been 50% speed for several days. Have rebooted modem, changed channel, etc. Online support chat is broken. Help?"

2017-10-31 10:55:56,So it turns the audio back on when I change it to English but I have to do it every time I flip to the channel? It was fine a few days ago
2017-10-31 10:49:29,Hi Lance! We have another box. It says ARRIS on it.

2017-10-29 08:05:21,@Shawhelp what should the settings be at when I go into the online site to change the channel or 2.4g / 5g settings?
2017-10-29 08:04:20,Morning!! Any help on how to open our Blue Sky remote to change the batteries?? Nothing feels natural and I don't want to force it open
2017-10-29 08:04:05,Pretty sure you work at a media hub and could multitask that one
2017-10-29 08:03:28,@Shawhelp Speedtest shows all is good but my iPhone is having trouble. Seems slow loading twitter page or Facebook page. Something isn’t rt
2017-10-29 08:01:59,@Shawhelp wifi in my house is wonky. Keeps switching from 2.4g to 5g connections. I’ve unplugged everything and started over but same issue
2017-10-29 02:09:50,@Shawhelp is there an issue in the Rocky Mountain House Area in Alberta?
2017-10-28 22:18:55,I made sure it worked . My ppv is working. It cost me $60 to find that out
2017-10-28 22:17:50,So tech wouldn't help. So I just spent $60 on a ppv I didn't want just to make sure I could have people over next week for ufc217
2017-10-28 22:16:04,UFC 216 played for 5 seconds. 1 tech told me to call when a another Ppv was on and they would activate it to ensure it was working.
2017-10-28 21:11:54,@Shawhelp any further updates?
2017-10-28 20:23:16,@Shawhelp Fisher Cres no cable or internet either.
2017-10-28 20:17:42,"Thanks, done"
2017-10-28 20:04:55,@Shawhelp no cable internet or phone confederation park area
2017-10-28 19:44:15,Must be a glitch in my Safari- am on beta. Sea Monkey ( Mozilla?) worked just fine.
2017-10-28 18:26:13,You too and thanks again.
2017-10-28 18:23:52,That would be great
2017-10-28 18:22:11,Wifi is back :-)
2017-10-28 18:21:08,Thanks for the quick response.
2017-10-28 18:15:49,@Shawhelp if I live in an area that only supports Shaw Internet 75 speeds could I still get the 150 package just for the unlimited data?
2017-10-28 18:11:51,I will let you know if it works
2017-10-28 18:09:55,Yup. Thanks
2017-10-28 18:07:01,Not yet. Unable to reset as I'm in a wheelchair and can't reach the box. Waiting for a friend to come by
2017-10-28 18:02:12,Shaw at home

2017-10-28 17:23:44,@Shawhelp Just spent 7.5 hours waiting and trying to get bluesky tv installed. Still not working.
2017-10-28 16:40:33,You will say maintenance like you did to others. Why are we paying full price for an entire week of this near nonexistence internet.
2017-10-28 16:31:48,@Shawhelp get your shit together if you can't provide me with the service I'm paying for then let me out of this shitty contract.
2017-10-28 16:09:49,"@Shawhelp what's the cost to replace a bluesky remote - I don't need to, (YET) but I have a puppy. I'm careful w/ it, but he's...adventurous"
2017-10-28 15:51:36,It solved it. Thanks
2017-10-28 15:41:16,@Shawhelp ...is there a problem accessing accounts? All I'm getting is spinorama ..... pic.twitter.com/KlRhNknyl8

2017-10-28 14:23:56,@Shawhelp We have no sound with cable right now. Sound works fine with Netflix & TMN. Any ideas?
2017-10-28 13:46:24,@Shawhelp The Internet 150 and Large TV bundle is $164.90/month for existing customers for 2 years?
2017-10-28 12:58:59,@Shawhelp Really Well Done on the festive Halloween goodies on the Frame Channel from the Female in the House
2017-10-28 10:53:18,Thanks! It is odd it’s missing. Wife & I look forward to Ep3!
2017-10-28 10:01:14,@Shawhelp just got BlueskyTV installed and now my AppleTV doesn't work. What gives?!

2017-10-28 06:19:29,@Shawhelp Need an update on if a tech will fix the only phone service of my 75yrs old mom living alone before the weekend is out. 1/2
2017-10-28 02:44:31,@shawhelp any plans to compensate customers for ridiculous service from maintenance every single night for an entire week???
2017-10-27 22:37:29,I'm in Abbotsford
2017-10-27 22:37:15,Power cycled my devices as well as modem & stb

2017-10-27 22:05:07,@Shawhelp #highriver shaw outage in high river :( luckily I still had some downloaded Netflix shows! Btw any estimated time for the fix???
2017-10-27 21:07:13,It’s not the bloody remote it’s your whole shitty bluesky platform. Customer for many many years with several accounts. This takes the cake.
2017-10-27 20:58:31,@ShawInfo #blueskytv #fail #sucks pay for VOD and get buffering pic.twitter.com/PP0M0mTt3J
2017-10-27 20:56:54,Now the movie we rented from Shaw VOD pauses/freezes/buffers!!! AWFUL PRODUCT
2017-10-27 20:48:47,All we do is run around and reset TV boxes which is horribly inconvenient and frustrating.
2017-10-27 20:47:45,"System is overall glitchy, laggy and plain horrible. Takes 3-4 tries for voice commands to work. You should NOT be putting this in customer’s houses!"
2017-10-27 20:40:40,@Shawhelp There’s nothing to do in Thompson without internet. Please fix it before I’m forced to do something productive. SOS!!!
2017-10-27 20:24:40,thanks. i will. i just don’t like not getting hd versions on these awesome bluesky boxes while the channels are hd in the freerange app.
2017-10-27 20:14:32,"Okay so it's CMT, NBC that's doing it."
2017-10-27 20:12:03,The whole channel glitches and stops.
2017-10-27 20:10:21,Sure. Brb.
2017-10-27 20:10:08,"Don't see it on http:// zap2it.com . Its not a team, it's a preview show...guess @TSN_Sports isn't showing it this week @CollegeGameDay"
2017-10-27 20:09:42,@Shawhelp hey it’s almost 2018. why aren’t all the channels in HD?
2017-10-27 20:08:25,Nope! Just the one
2017-10-27 20:02:30,@Shawhelp CMT has sound for 3 seconds and then cuts out. It's fine on other tvs. What can I do?

2017-10-27 17:00:54,"@Shawhelp Congrats #ShawCable , you have lost a 16 yr loyal customer for both tv and internet due to absolutely awful customer service."
2017-10-27 16:58:36,Yes this is wifi for sure.

2017-10-27 15:52:55,@Shawhelp the only way to get any service from Shaw is to tweet about their bullshit #ShawSucks
2017-10-27 15:52:05,@Shawhelp shaw only cares until you move and cancel services. they dont care about loyalty ! #ShawSucks
2017-10-27 15:50:12,@Shawhelp i was wrong to delete previous tweet #ShawSucks after all

2017-10-26 20:50:18,But I've been using it since free range came out. As its handy to have when wanting to watch a canucks game at the dinner table.
2017-10-26 20:49:19,"Yes, I'm logging in with my account info. It just says add account and then it will take up to 24 hours to activate."

2017-10-25 19:14:40,I don’t think that’s the problem. Wired speeds aren’t that much faster than wireless. Thanks though.
2017-10-25 19:13:30,"Alas, that’s not the case. Wired speeds are only slightly faster at 47.65 mbps."
2017-10-25 19:12:08,"Ah, I see. Good point. Connection speed looks around the same for both."
2017-10-25 19:10:30,"Over wifi. Haven’t tried a wired connection lately. But most of our internet devices are wifi, so that’s what I care about most."
2017-10-25 19:08:27,No. Still around 43 mbps.
2017-10-25 19:06:18,Yes. Did you just reset the modem? The modem appears to have reset itself.
2017-10-25 19:00:33,Thanks. Would the Shaw Cable signal have cut out when I unplugged the modem?
2017-10-25 18:58:21,Just unplugged for about 45 seconds & plugged back in. Let’s see what happens.
2017-10-25 18:56:57,Thank you!
2017-10-25 18:54:42,I will try in a bit. I recently upgraded from internet 30 to internet 75. Maybe something wasn’t changed over correctly?
2017-10-25 18:52:55,"Just tested a wired connection. Slightly faster, but not by much. 42.32 mbps."
2017-10-25 18:46:32,@Shawhelp I’m currently paying for 75 mbps of internet service. Why am I getting less than 30? pic.twitter.com/f5hEuaoUbm
2017-10-25 18:26:38,It worked. Sorry I bothered you!
2017-10-25 18:24:47,Turned off the modem. It’s coming back now. Give me a minute. I’ll let you know if it worked!
2017-10-25 18:22:16,@Shawhelp I had internet and cable hooked up today and it appears that my WiFi isn’t working. Please help.

2017-10-11 08:11:41,"@Shawhelp Hi, I'm getting an intermittent internet connection (it was also down late last night)."
2017-10-11 01:14:28,@shawhelp would love to know why your stupid STBs take forever to change stations if you turn them on just after midnight....
2017-10-10 23:18:10,@Shawhelp is there any reason why the internet has been spotty-to-nonexistent since the weekend pic.twitter.com/SKgaCRTTvO
2017-10-10 23:16:27,@Shawhelp suddenly our net cut out Saskatoon. Connect no net.tried restart. All devices no net.
2017-10-10 23:14:42,"@Shawhelp @ShawInfo Very happy to report, as I said I would, that Shaw came through for me today. Install done. Thank you!"
2017-10-10 22:36:35,He now knows how to stream it.
2017-10-10 22:32:52,"Oh sorry, you said does not"
2017-10-10 22:31:03,How do I log into that?
2017-10-10 22:28:06,"302 won't work, 326 does and has the game, (He had no idea he had the channel but is happy.) Pls check your help line and thanks."
2017-10-10 22:25:37,@Shawhelp why is the Canucks game blacked out in Victoria?
2017-10-10 22:22:55,@Shawhelp We are asking support if our NHL GameCenter subscription allows us to watch games online. They are sending us to DAZN?!
2017-10-10 22:14:40,We couldn't agree more here in Nelson.
2017-10-10 22:03:25,Still nothing
2017-10-10 21:53:17,Everything else plug into the power bar works. It just shows orange light online. No green for power.
2017-10-10 21:44:17,"@Shawhelp hi, I think I need a new modem. Got home and no lights on it. Power is on."
2017-10-10 21:09:42,@Shawhelp net is down again any idea??
2017-10-10 20:56:03,@Shawhelp hey peoples. Can you look into some connections issues at my friends place? I can dm you the address and room number.
2017-10-10 20:37:59,"Yes, I am watching on 302. Just thought you might like to know what is happening on 223. Thanks for the help."
2017-10-10 20:32:48,I'm having the same problem. Why wouldn't you guys just put the game on 223 since there's literally nothing playing on that channel.
2017-10-10 20:31:57,It has been messed up by the rainout of the baseball game. But SN says it should be on pacific but all I see there is this. pic.twitter.com/L58C5gjreY
2017-10-10 20:29:26,@Shawhelp My 79yo landlord your customer wants to know what cable service shows Canuck games in the interior of BC? You don't.
2017-10-10 20:29:19,Found it. What not on 223 SNP?
2017-10-10 20:27:44,@Shawhelp Fun trick you have going with the help line just be a loop and never talking to a rep. but I had a question...
2017-10-10 20:15:41,"@Shawhelp Hey Help-Friends... Any suggestions for when my channels get glitchy? Canucks game on 302 is hard to watch, 245 is unwatchable."
2017-10-10 20:08:43,@Shawhelp : what channel is the @Canucks game in #Vancouver ??
2017-10-10 19:58:32,Yes we are! Thank you for the update. It seems to be working but still a bit slow. We will continue to check for updates! Thank you.
2017-10-10 19:49:54,@Shawhelp are there currently any outages in downtown Calgary? We are having some issues with our internet. Let us know! Thanks
2017-10-10 19:47:04,@Shawhelp HI! My tv says signal loss detected and I tried resetting the box. Is there anything else I can do?

2017-10-10 18:35:47,So it's still listed as PPV even if you have Sportsnet One? It is a little confusing
2017-10-10 18:27:54,yeah. thanks
2017-10-10 18:24:00,I wasn’t sure if that was a retail location.
2017-10-10 18:18:46,@Shawhelp I’m looking to trade in a remote that isn’t working. Do you know if i can do that at the west edmonton building? (10450 178 St NW)

2017-10-10 18:00:48,Same outlet
