2017-11-10 11:55:14,What is a DM
2017-11-10 11:51:28,"So you are saying that you can not help me and I have to go back to Telus after all these years, because they could would not help me with a problem back then!!!"
2017-11-10 11:46:23,But then I have no internet for the computer that the hitron is set next to.
2017-11-10 11:43:15,Sorry did you miss my comment that said I cant. So how am I able to get this TV hardwired??? I have been with you guys for years and need someone to help me
2017-11-10 11:35:44,How can we enable it?
2017-11-10 11:32:57,But my house is fully developed so that does not work. Why is there a internet slot in the gateway if I can't use it ?
2017-11-10 11:27:47,Yeah I guess I could be. It is the one down stairs that it in my utility box
2017-11-10 11:25:13,My Son says I should be able to get it from the Arris down stairs

2017-11-10 11:12:18,"@Shawhelp .So, my DVR keeps resetting. Has happened a couple of times this week alone. What's up?"
2017-11-10 11:00:14,Great.
2017-11-10 10:55:38,Just WiFi.
2017-11-10 10:53:00,"An ""expected results"" indicator in your speed tester wouldn't hurt."
2017-11-10 10:51:22,@Shawhelp my internet keeps dropping every few minutes. Is there some work being done? I've already reset the modem.
2017-11-10 10:42:37,"2 up, 4.5 down. I've been getting dropoffs as well. A reset of my modem seems to have dealt with the problem, as I'm not getting those bad results anymore, but I can't be certain of anything."
2017-11-10 10:35:17,"Troubleshooting requires knowing the cause, and I have no way to know what that is."
2017-11-10 10:30:30,@Shawhelp Saying my speed test results are lower than expected means nothing when you won't tell me WHY it's too low.
2017-11-10 10:24:05,@Shawhelp guess I'm going to @TELUS . Customer loyalty at Shaw means milk the cash cow
2017-11-10 10:20:19,"So can this impact the overall speed available to me? If there are enough Freedom users connected will I see an overall speed slowdown, wired and WiFi?"

2017-11-09 20:14:34,"@Shawhelp Incredibly disappointed today after a second visit from your cable technician and still no cable. This time though, he cut our internet cable.

2017-11-09 20:07:50,"It changes so fast, 4, 5, & 6 were lowest for a minute. I did manage to get speed up on channel 4, hoping not have to do this again for a while. Thank you 4 ur help!!!"

2017-11-09 19:48:59,Got it up to 14mbps with fresh re-boot. Will look at channels next. As an aside I am doing this alot more than I use to - not really satisfied with Shaw!
2017-11-09 19:41:49,@Shawhelp Shaw needs to get their shit together I swear if my internet goes down once more before a midterm or essay
2017-11-09 19:41:47,Thanks for your help. Your suggestions worked.
2017-11-09 19:37:47,All is says is to re-boot. I've done that so many times already. I get 20mbps but 5 or 7 at $85/month?
2017-11-09 19:34:48,This happens alot! Here's your speed test pic.twitter.com/BF4Jw5yfAq
2017-11-09 19:32:14,No connection to internet with an Ethernet cable from the modem
2017-11-09 19:26:35,@shawhelp why is my wifi signal only providing less than 5% of the 25mbps speed that I am paying for? pic.twitter.com/OVybaNa0c6

2017-11-09 19:11:30,Will do. My downstairs tv works fine. Just the box upstairs having issues.

2017-11-09 19:08:14,@Shawhelp is the internet having issues in Sault Ste Marie?
2017-11-09 19:04:38,Talking to my TV is great but if it doesn't respond it doesn't matter. It's like having a teenager.
2017-11-09 19:02:56,We have had this issue several times in the last few weeks. It tells us to reset it. We try it and it takes several attempts but finally does reset. I like my old Shaw cable better.
2017-11-09 19:01:14,It tells me it is having issues connecting to the portal. I can continue watching the current program but not change channels or bring up the guide.
2017-11-09 18:56:55,@Shawhelp So everytime it snows or rains is my Shaw Bluesky going to not work properly??? Just curious.
2017-11-09 18:45:40,And the cable companies wonder why people are going to streaming. Show something we want.
2017-11-09 18:37:37,"Yea i called 220 bucks and i lost a month.There should be at least some game on! We live in canada, a hockey country! with many games on again and no access to any is pretty sad!"

2017-11-09 18:15:10,"@Shawhelp I can’t get an Internet connection tonight,the DS light keeps flashing on my modem. I tried the coaxial cable at the back already"
2017-11-09 18:11:52,"Nope, they aren't. Top one is sold, second and last light are flashing. I've also tried rebooting several times."
2017-11-09 18:08:26,"@Shawhelp does Thunder Bay, Ontario have an outage for Internet?"
2017-11-09 17:47:55,Good evening. This gentleman may not be a customer. He is referring to a next door neighbour and a cable across his driveway that Shaw laid so it would be the cable team.
2017-11-09 16:44:19,Internet for the first time didn't drop as well... still very obviously slow service in that department too... been a frustrating few months with y'all
2017-11-09 16:40:06,I unplugged it and it reset.... it just sucks that we have had to do this so often! We haven't even been compensated for all the issues we've encountered! Is that up to us to make you offer something?!
2017-11-09 16:31:27,@Shawhelp ??? Just documenting another glitch... pretty laughable now that we stay on as a customer pic.twitter.com/yVRj9wlQCk
2017-11-09 15:37:27,yes agreed. And this is a recent occurrence. I've been able to connect recently to hotspots here.
2017-11-09 15:31:14,I will see if it works at another hotspot. The problem seems to be that this hotspot is not asking/prompting for user info. Can't even change the config to enter it.
2017-11-09 15:25:33,"Galaxy s6. And yes, I've done ""forget network"" several times."
2017-11-09 15:20:31,"yes I can see ShawOpen but cannot connect. Says Authentication error, even though I haven't entered and can't enter my uid/pwd info."
2017-11-09 15:10:10,@Shawhelp currently having an issue with connecting to ShawOpen. Are there known problems in Nanaimo?
2017-11-09 15:07:03,@Shawhelp Troy in Winnipeg took my Shaw internet help phone call. He fixed the problem like a boss in seconds flat. He hardly said a word. Thanks Troy. #wificall

2017-11-08 22:05:55,@Shawhelp why isn't BBC World News in HD on Shaw? You barely have any HD channels. Have you seen Telus? 2x the number of HD channels compared to you. Don't make me switch to them.

2017-11-06 21:19:58,"I pay for Shaw 150, but I've been getting like maybe 20mbps down. Reset the router. Didn't fix. Not sure what to do?"

2017-11-06 19:37:58,Thanks for email from SVP and cust serv response to the issue. Glitches happen to all companies... your response was great.
2017-11-06 18:56:53,Same time. Not always the same two series. Usually second show will error out. If we don’t catch the message (TV off) we lose the show.
2017-11-06 18:52:00,@Shawhelp fix you’re shit I’m sick of my internet crashing !!!
2017-11-06 18:46:06,Yeah. It was down for 90 minutes. It was just bad timing but the new rig is up and running

2017-11-05 15:36:42,@Shawhelp your employees cutting people off doesn’t seem like professional practice. License plate KV 3650 at 2:25 today
2017-11-05 15:17:58,Yes we are! Is there an expected time for it to be back up?

2017-11-05 14:17:20,I just checked on Shaw.ca and it appears that it is possible to order a brand new Gateway via online order for $348. Is that still true?
2017-11-05 14:12:43,"Okay, I will tell them, thanks. Is it possible to order a new Gateway from Shaw? She said she phoned Shaw and was referred to BestBuy."
2017-11-05 14:07:03,Interesting. So it would be pretty risky ordering online from BestBuy then? No indication of previous years of use. Says check with Shaw
2017-11-05 14:02:54,Apparently it's blacked out in BC. Silly NHL. Thanks for your help!
2017-11-05 14:00:15,"Excellent! Ps. If they buy the refurbished Gateway from Best Buy, what is the warranty? BestBuy said the warranty is with Shaw."
2017-11-05 14:00:06,Is it possible to watch on a laptop then? Or no?
2017-11-05 13:55:43,They don't care if they are interconnected. Just want to add a 3rd PVR to their setup without losing their other PVRs and the recorded shows
2017-11-05 13:54:45,I am asking for a friend. They have one Pace and one Motorola PVR I believe. They simply want to add a TV to their house with a Gateway pvr
2017-11-05 13:46:28,"@Shawhelp If you buy a new Shaw Gateway Box, can you just add it to a new TV and keep using your existing PVRs and all their recordings?"
2017-11-05 13:34:02,Hi my internet's been down all day. Any eta on when it'll be back up?
2017-11-05 13:18:06,@Shawhelp thanks Lance for the update. Hopefully it's fixed soon. Cheers

2017-11-05 12:39:57,Yes. Even checked tomorrow's listings. All there. The white swirl instead of series record is on all pre-sets. Fixd one but not the others.
2017-11-05 12:36:14,@Shawhelp are there issues in Sault Ste Marie?
2017-11-05 12:29:08,Seems to be okay today.. Just not the most fun when you're trying to do updates ;)

2017-11-05 12:16:47,Happy. Took a few minutes to get back the TV listings. Recordings are back. Not my pre-set to record. Still have a white swirl.

2017-11-05 11:21:11,Im sure you guys can. I pay you 200+ a month for service. It is the least you can do...
2017-11-05 11:17:11,I would like to have a month to preview it.

2017-11-04 23:01:29,wifi was terrible! all night!
2017-11-04 22:57:37,"@Shawhelp wow, way to drop the ball on arguably one of the best UFC cards on the past 5 years."
2017-11-04 22:56:04,Too late! We figured something else out #refund
2017-11-04 22:53:57,Accidentally started a ppv. Some ufc fight. Did not watch. What do I do?
2017-11-04 22:53:20,"@Shawhelp sure hope I don't get charged for the ufc tonight, missed the whole show"
2017-11-04 22:50:38,Any chance I'll get a refund. Had to cab it to the bar. Missed the first 90 min
2017-11-04 22:49:41,"Nope, not working."
2017-11-04 22:42:00,Thanks @Shawhelp ...missed the finish.
2017-11-04 22:38:30,"I’m not on blue sky, just have a black screen. Help."

2017-11-04 22:29:00,@Shawhelp payed for the UFC fight tonight and as soon as the main card begins... black screen. #pissed
2017-11-04 22:24:14,"2 hours and 20 mins and it just came on, the last frickin fight! Wow @ShawInfo @shawhelp you better not charge us!"
2017-11-04 22:23:41,I have blue sky but I already paid for it when I ordered it. Will I get a refund? This has been a mess. I had a bunch of friends over for it
2017-11-04 22:23:34,"All good, started working awhile ago now but thank you"
2017-11-04 22:20:39,Brutal
2017-11-04 22:19:41,"what a joke of service ""we will credit you the fight"" well obviously you are not going to charge for a fight I didn't get @Shawhelp"
2017-11-04 22:18:53,So ooooooo... Still working on it?
2017-11-04 22:18:25,@Shawhelp my order of the ufc pay per view just froze before the main event.
2017-11-04 22:17:30,How long???
2017-11-04 22:16:43,@Shawhelp thanks for freezing & making me miss GSP's walk in!!!
2017-11-04 22:16:30,Kinda late I think. I suspect you won't be charging me.
2017-11-04 22:14:10,I will like to have a refund on my account.
2017-11-04 22:09:46,@Shawhelp how are you going to make this right? Customers wanted to and couldn't watch UFC 217!!
2017-11-04 22:09:24,@Shawhelp how come at least 3 times a day it says connection error contact shaw then a minute later the channel comes back
2017-11-04 22:09:17,"All good, problem resolved"
2017-11-04 22:06:16,@shawhelp any idea whats going on? I've replaced my splitter and coax. This is on 150 Package from New Westminster http:// shaw.speedtestcustom.com/result/47a55ed 0-c1de-11e7-b0f9-e7227c8578af …
2017-11-04 22:01:40,1/2.
2017-11-04 21:57:05,Uhhh @Shawhelp I think I just let you know. Give me a * #to a manager and we'll talk - as will all the other people gathered in my basement
2017-11-04 21:53:59,UNACCEPTABLE. Unless you can drastically lower our bills and FULL REFUND expect myself as well as im sure many others to switch to TELUS.
2017-11-04 21:48:58,Too late
2017-11-04 21:48:58,@shawhelp The main event on TSN is over. Can I have the UFC fight yet?
2017-11-04 21:45:40,@Shawhelp we're going to miss the fight aren't we? What's going on! pic.twitter.com/adDB5H4Myq
2017-11-04 21:44:39,Working on a fix lol? Its almost over. #youhadonejob
2017-11-04 21:42:56,How can we still not see the fights? We also got hung up by CS. Phone number 604 308 4698
2017-11-04 21:39:26,Btw it's not just blue sky customers
2017-11-04 21:39:17,"Waste of time. Your ""investigation"" took an hour. Just had to charge on my iPhone instead. Better not be charged."
2017-11-04 21:38:34,@Shawhelp is there even a timeline? Cause it would be nice to know if I should order on the internet or wait until it is fixed.
2017-11-04 21:38:14,@Shawhelp missing the fights . hour later. pic.twitter.com/Vjd3lAWJdY
2017-11-04 21:37:42,"@Shawhelp dude, I'm trying to watch the GSP fight and your Bluebox is lights out. #YourePayinForThis #ShawMoreLikeNaw"
2017-11-04 21:36:24,No it says it’s have issues tuning to channel and something about my account.
2017-11-04 21:36:18,Yes just a loading screen on channel 601. Employee account....
2017-11-04 21:36:01,"Hey Shaw, absolutely NO EXCUSES FOR THIS ONE! For the $$$ you charge monthly you guys can't get a ppv going? Get your shit together!!! pic.twitter.com/Ub2oDuv5l1"
2017-11-04 21:35:53,a little late dont you think? Blusky bs. $170 a month and missed the ppv how do you make this up to me for my inconvevience.
2017-11-04 21:34:51,WHEN WILL THIS BE FIXED
2017-11-04 21:34:21,@Shawhelp I am one of the Blue Sky people that can’t get the fight. “on hold” guy is telling me to go to 300 or 324 - I don’t have those
2017-11-04 21:33:51,We have a house full of people too and no UFC! What the hell! Had to pay a sitter and Shaw won’t pay me back for that!!
2017-11-04 21:33:38,"@Shawhelp don't worry Shaw, we ordered through IOS. Better not be showing on our bill. Took an hour for an ""investigation"" still no resolve."
2017-11-04 21:32:35,Thanks but we called in and they said it was some back end issue affecting it for a majority of customers.
2017-11-04 21:31:42,It’s not some customer it’s everyone on your blueskytv!!! @ShawInfo @shawhelp
2017-11-04 21:30:47,"@Shawhelp @Telus Hey Telus, hit me up, I need a new provider."
2017-11-04 21:30:36,On bluesky as well and not working. Cancelled it and just found a stream instead
2017-11-04 21:30:35,@shawhelp To Everyone looking for a refund. You have to contact THEM within 24-48 hours to get refund. They are not just giving us one.
2017-11-04 21:30:01,It’s been an hour and a half and still nothing! Come on @shawhelp
2017-11-04 21:26:55,@Shawhelp Hilarious! No UFC pay-per-view but Shaw just delivered my bill for the month. Thanks! So I guess billing works. #Disappointed
2017-11-04 21:26:26,@Shawhelp #FuckShaw
2017-11-04 21:25:41,@Shawhelp what's going on? This is stupid we paid for this
2017-11-04 21:25:26,"He already got it working with your help, about 40 minutes ago. Thanks!"
2017-11-04 21:25:23,@Shawhelp Shaw chat wait is 31 hours.....hmmmmmm. You guys are a piece of SHIT!!!! Fuck You!
2017-11-04 21:24:18,To think we just switched to BlueSkyTV then this?? Seriously epic fail @shaw
2017-11-04 21:21:32,@Shawhelp what is happening with our ufc tonight
2017-11-04 21:20:51,Blue Sky? More like Blue Cry.
2017-11-04 21:20:38,"@Shawhelp So, is a fix on the way for #ufc217 ? I ordered it yesterday no problem, but am now seeing black."
2017-11-04 21:19:13,@Shawhelp any word on when the fix will be?
2017-11-04 21:18:40,"Okay, I've Got A Bunch Of Very Unhappy People Here... Uncluding Myself... Hopefully Something Is Done, If This Isn't Resolved.."
2017-11-04 21:18:18,Just got Blue Sky to not watch UFC 217. Great job.
2017-11-04 21:17:50,@Shawhelp at this point you should be giving it away for free. This is ridiculous
2017-11-04 21:16:28,@Shawhelp Brutal pay-per-view service w/ Shaw tonight for UFC12. 8 people over. Custom UFC belt up for grabs. NO FEED! #Disappointed pic.twitter.com/JMLy1U7J9C
2017-11-04 21:15:02,@Shawhelp Found a fix guys. Cancel Shaw services order @TELUS services
2017-11-04 21:13:27,We gave up and ordered it online. No patience for poor service when it's an event like this.
2017-11-04 21:11:47,We have a house full of people here. No PPV. This is fun. Thanks for ruining the night Shaw.

2017-11-04 21:09:38,Great!!! So we basically can't watch a fight we paid for? No issues with the last ppv we ordered so what changed ???
2017-11-04 21:09:03,Will you replay it for all of us that are missing it!!!
2017-11-04 21:08:50,So we are getting it for free then??
2017-11-04 21:08:41,Shaw support chat just decided to disconnect on me after sending me a link to the support page...that's fun.
2017-11-04 21:08:41,Blue sky always f’s up —
2017-11-04 21:08:32,@Shawhelp I sent a direct message. Just wanted to make sure I’m not getting charged for the UFC fight as I can’t access it
2017-11-04 21:08:03,@Shawhelp start streaming it for us to watch
2017-11-04 21:07:15,Blue sky is the worst provider I’ve ever had. So disappointed and can’t wait to get out of my contract
2017-11-04 21:06:58,Is there any hope it will be on before the end of the fights? I'm still expecting a full refund either way
2017-11-04 21:06:37,Not a good start to our “new” BlueSky experience!
2017-11-04 21:06:37,Please check your dm
2017-11-04 21:06:13,@Shawhelp Same issues here. Bluesky not getting a signal even though order was confirmed
2017-11-04 21:06:13,Did you try turning it off and turning it back on?
2017-11-04 21:06:05,I have a feeling we are all on blue sky—
2017-11-04 21:05:48,@shawhelp will be shopping at telus tomorrow. #sad . You wont even reply to a blusky customer or answer your phones
2017-11-04 21:05:26,"There better not be any charges on my bill.... Your crap gateway and internet act up constantly, getting charged will be it for me."
2017-11-04 21:05:23,Please check your dm i have supplied my account njmber
2017-11-04 21:05:01,@Shawhelp still waiting for answer here..... waste of my money.
2017-11-04 21:04:43,Is that why I’ve been on hold for 65 min?
2017-11-04 21:04:38,@Shawhelp Can you please help me access the GSP fight? Getting black screen. Thanks!
2017-11-04 21:04:26,We better not have to pay for this... already missed an hour of the fights
2017-11-04 21:04:23,And everyone here knows it’s gonna take 4-6 months to fight them to take the charges off
2017-11-04 21:04:16,I guess you don’t reply to people that have already dmd you?
2017-11-04 21:04:01,If it comes on i want half off
2017-11-04 21:03:55,It’s been over a hr
2017-11-04 21:03:38,@Shawhelp HOW DO YOU GUYS LET THIS HAPPEN WITH YOUR PAPER VIEWS!?!?!? THIS IS NOT A GOOD LOOK!!
2017-11-04 21:03:22,No point in waiting anymore! Let me know if there will be refunds.
2017-11-04 21:02:26,There's no order button anymore. We've tried everything and after an hour on hold we hung up. Read that Shaw is telling people to just wait
2017-11-04 21:02:18,Still not working! Tried everything!
2017-11-04 21:01:09,I've given up on shaw and ordered on iOS. I'll be expecting a refund if I see a charge on my bill.
2017-11-04 21:01:07,"So, full refunds for this disaster? This is embarrassing."
2017-11-04 21:00:57,It better not be on the bill...
2017-11-04 21:00:24,Come on!!!

2017-11-02 19:18:11,@Shawhelp haven't had my cordless phone connected when I plug it in it says no line. Also no tv as it says no gateway portal. Assistance?
2017-11-02 19:05:15,Hello Phedra-Lyn ! Looks like your signal is cutting out due to accumulated snow on the dish. Plz DM us for more info on fixing this. :) *ml
2017-11-02 19:00:18,@Shawhelp is it possible to fast toward through commercials/30 seconds at a time w blue sky? Also there's no stop button is there?
2017-11-02 18:54:19,I didn’t want to make changes I wanted to watch the game on the channel I get as planned. Should have given free SN360 last eve
2017-11-02 18:48:05,I’m on the way home now. My wife texted me about the internet. I’ll check tv when I get there.
2017-11-02 18:45:09,We have cable. I’m concerned because I adjusted my tv options today and the agent was less than helpful.
2017-11-02 18:41:36,@Shawhelp is there an internet outage for the Killarney area of Vancouver?
2017-11-02 18:19:28,@Shawhelp we haven’t even had the call back option. Please let me know. We have urgent questions. Thanks
2017-11-02 18:08:20,@Shawhelp the shows I pvr’d are either not New like it states or the wrong show altogether
2017-11-02 17:57:55,"@Shawhelp What’s up with the onscreen listings for BBC Earth, they’ve been a mess for days."
2017-11-02 17:55:50,"I'm switching to Telus, should have a long time ago. You treat your long term customers like garbage!"
2017-11-02 16:50:42,@Shawhelp is there an internet outage in cloverdale. My internet is out
2017-11-02 15:05:50,"@Shawhelp Do you know why I would suddenly have a problem today signing in to my Shaw on Demand app? It's making me sign in, then tells me I don't have access to the service. But I can still access my On Demand stuff on the TV as usual."
2017-11-02 14:05:18,@Shawhelp any reason why cable and internet would be down in Surrey bc right now?
2017-11-02 13:34:29,@Shawhelp Hi we have noticed a lot of static on our home phones lately. Is there anything that we can try try to clear this up?
2017-11-02 12:44:35,Thank you
2017-11-02 12:34:35,"@Shawhelp internet and cable out in Grandin area of St.Albert, AB. Is this a known outage?"
2017-11-02 12:23:09,@Shawhelp why is my internet keep cutting out at random times. You guys just did maintenance and ever since my wifi sucks... thanks
2017-11-02 12:13:44,@shawhelp no sound on Shaw 83 NBC - sound is fine on all other channels
2017-11-02 12:06:30,"@Shawhelp our internet is down for 3rd time today. We're trying to work, what is going on?"
2017-11-02 11:49:19,Wife fixed it. Just needed to reset gateway bix. Thanks Phil!
2017-11-02 11:40:09,Thanks...my wife is calling in. Im at work so Ill let her handle it. Was just curious if it was systematic or just isolated.
2017-11-02 11:30:48,@Shawhelp Is there a problem with the cable in Britnell NE Edmonton? Havent had cable signal all day.
2017-11-02 11:15:49,@Shawhelp Internet really slow in Sth Surrey right now. Paying for 150 but only get 67 w/ direct link to modem. Traffic? weather? aliens?
2017-11-02 10:07:37,"Also experiencing no service in Citadel, Calgary"
2017-11-02 10:00:54,And also no phone service
2017-11-02 09:59:24,Also in Citadel and have no internet or tv services
2017-11-02 09:55:04,Telus had it!!!
2017-11-02 09:54:50,"@Shawhelp hi, Citadel, Calgary #YYC resident here... Just lost all your services... Is there an area outage?"
2017-11-02 09:53:52,Why black it out. Thought you had a licence to broadcast????
2017-11-02 08:34:42,download is at 4 where it should be 20?? It's been like this forever I'm getting jipped. It's a game on my ps4.
2017-11-02 08:30:31,@Shawhelp Why the hell does it take 17hrs to download a 50gb file huh? I've tried to get assistance dozens of times but no change hello?????
2017-11-02 08:10:16,Thanks!
2017-11-02 06:50:46,@Shawhelp when will the fireplace channel make an appearance?
2017-11-02 01:27:42,"@Shawhelp DS light is off, US light is flashing on modem. Tried unplugging power, coax and using reset button. Is it something on your end?"
2017-11-01 23:38:02,@Shawhelp is your server down? I'm in the Winnipeg maples area and the modem seemed to have just stopped sending ping.
2017-11-01 22:26:32,Feels bad when shaw gets blamed for the nhl's blackout restrictions
2017-11-01 22:19:01,Or a problem with the TV or PVR for the same reasons.
2017-11-01 22:18:30,I honestly don't think it's the signal. I do not think I've ever seen this issue on CBC. It doesn't happen with any other show or sport.
2017-11-01 22:13:19,It only seems to be Sportsnet related. I'll wait until a game is on both CBC and a SN and see if I can't determine if it's the channel.
2017-11-01 22:07:00,Doesn’t help one bit when you thought you recorded Canucks game on sportnet and then find out you have recorded the World Series twice#telus
2017-11-01 22:05:35,"Also, despite my having done nothing to the cable or the TV it seems to have ceased doing it."
2017-11-01 22:04:55,"Funnily enough, we do not have any other boxes in the house, not sure why you always think we do."
2017-11-01 21:54:02,Unfortunately the PVR is suffering anyway and cannot be relied on to show even the non jerky play reliably.
2017-11-01 21:53:24,"It happens all over the ice, but is reasonably guaranteed to happen each time the play crosses through the neutral zone."
2017-11-01 21:46:04,@Shawhelp I just got my bill for the month and it says I ordered a UFC event that I never watched. Why would I order a month old event?
2017-11-01 21:41:12,Each of the first 3 or 4 times I've brought it up with you all. It happens just too often at the same spots on the ice to be the connection
2017-11-01 21:35:41,"...speed and cuts frames or something, but I have no setting like that set. I'm fairly sure that it gets sent by you or Sportsnet this way."
2017-11-01 21:34:27,It's nothing to do with that. The TV has no other signal problems on any other channels. It is possible that the TV can't handle...cont...
2017-11-01 21:28:16,@Shawhelp . You must be part of the a government sector. Cause you don’t do anything and charge me $250/month. I hate u!
2017-11-01 21:22:28,@Shawhelp the Canucks game on 302 is doing that jerky movement thing that I've been complaining about.
2017-11-01 21:20:47,You people are Stellar and Wonderful TYVM
2017-11-01 21:10:41,"Ok it is what it is, sorry for being snarky I love my Canucks!"
2017-11-01 21:03:31,Just a notice of blackout restrictions. No need to show Leafs on multiple channels and screw Canuck fans. #comeonman
2017-11-01 21:01:37,Way to go Shaw you screwed us again. I PVRd the wrong game thanks to you. Why do you keep doing this? Get your act together
2017-11-01 20:57:26,@Shawhelp I just got CraveTV thru Shaw. Can I access it on my laptop when not at home?
2017-11-01 20:56:58,"That's ridiculous! My on tv guide shows the game on Sportsnet 360. Multiple channels showing Leafs game, so that's B.S."
2017-11-01 20:52:12,In the past when there was schedule issues they put the game on PPV channel
2017-11-01 20:49:53,Looking for this game in Sask. Not necessary to show the damn Leafs on multiple channels is it? Where is the Canucks game I paid for?
2017-11-01 20:47:05,Unacceptable! You’ve screwed us again Shaw. Shame on you.
2017-11-01 20:45:32,I'm a huge #Devils fan and this is completely unacceptable. Why am I paying for it??
2017-11-01 20:45:15,nope
2017-11-01 20:44:04,I experience this multiple times a year and it gets old really quick. Blackouts are complete crap
2017-11-01 20:43:09,So I had plans and people over to watch the game that was advertised. This crap is why people don't pay for cable anymore
2017-11-01 20:39:47,@Shawhelp complete bullshit advertising games on subscribed channels then changing programming and blacking out other options for game
2017-11-01 20:38:59,So I need to move to B.C. to watch the Devils play? Ok...
2017-11-01 20:34:41,Then make 360 free tonight. Simple fix.
2017-11-01 20:33:04,Are you serious?
2017-11-01 20:32:59,"Hey @Shawhelp , your guide info is wrong. Game is listed on incorrect channels. I Found it on 302 because of this tweet."
2017-11-01 20:32:26,Please read back my tweets and you might understand my frustration.
2017-11-01 20:30:49,World series is on multiple channels already. Wwwhhhyyy bump the oilers??
2017-11-01 20:30:33,"I know it’s not your call, but that’s SO dumb."
2017-11-01 20:28:31,This is all I’m getting pic.twitter.com/bMAb3UueJt
2017-11-01 20:25:12,HEY! 302 & 326 is dead air! I live in AB and paid for Centre Ice to watch the Canucks. Wasn’t an issue vs Dallas Monday. Fix this now.
2017-11-01 20:22:42,Canucks/Devils.
2017-11-01 20:20:18,Sent you a PM but found it on 328. Thanks! :)
2017-11-01 20:20:15,I ended up on mango tv
2017-11-01 20:16:32,"So... the game won't be shown on Sportnet, which I pay for, nor the NHL cable package, which I also pay for? Nice."
2017-11-01 20:16:22,302 and 326 are both blank in Edmonton saying Not Subscribed (I do have the ice pack).
2017-11-01 20:16:16,Liars. Where the hell is the Oilers game???
2017-11-01 20:15:11,302 tells me I'm not subscribed to that channel.
2017-11-01 20:15:03,360 should be enabled on a free preview then for tonight in Alberta
2017-11-01 20:15:02,It's on 328
2017-11-01 20:14:42,How uninformed are you? It's on SN360. Guide says Devils vs Canucks and no subscription necessary. I give up. @shawnohelp
2017-11-01 20:14:12,Tried all of them and nada.
2017-11-01 20:13:57,Thank you
2017-11-01 20:13:08,I'm in Manitoba... nothing but dead air on both 302 and 326.
2017-11-01 20:12:54,Thanks! We were floundering!!
2017-11-01 20:12:18,@Shawhelp where is the Canucks game? Says Canucks vs Devils and the Oilers game is on pic.twitter.com/i1nOUCYxWz
2017-11-01 20:12:00,@Shawhelp guide says it on 223 but Baseball game is on. So because sportsnet changed things I'm out of luck?
2017-11-01 20:10:16,Where’s the Canucks game? It was supposed to be on 360!
2017-11-01 20:08:47,What about the Devils/Canucks?
2017-11-01 20:08:28,U people had this so screwed up this evening. Time to look at an alternative provider. Fed up with inaccurate guides. And I PAY ENOUGH!
2017-11-01 20:04:47,blank screen. :(
2017-11-01 20:04:34,"Don't have 302 and it says I have to subscribe for 326. I've been able to watch it on 326 before without a problem. ""Info"" just gives me a"
2017-11-01 20:04:15,I’ll give it a try later tonight. Thanks!
2017-11-01 20:01:57,"It’s super weird. We even reset the modem and router and can only get the 5GZ working. Oh well, at least one does!"
2017-11-01 19:53:04,Can I get a follow for dm’s
2017-11-01 19:50:38,So how do I get 360?
2017-11-01 19:49:27,@Shawhelp Not everyone wants to give you more money for less and less - Oilers game on SN360 that I don't want to pay for. Boo Shaw!
2017-11-01 19:47:42,Thanks mate!
2017-11-01 19:47:01,You guys suck! Who cares about a baseball game between 2 teams thousands of miles away.
2017-11-01 19:45:56,@Shawhelp any help getting the oilers game tonight? I have sports net but can’t find the game anywhere
2017-11-01 19:44:53,You're right
2017-11-01 19:44:49,Jk
2017-11-01 19:44:36,I guess we'll fine out in 15 minutes
2017-11-01 19:41:17,pic.twitter.com/4XWO8l1ppu
2017-11-01 19:41:01,Is there any other way to watch it other way than to pay for it? I'm quite annoyed that they are prioritizing poker and baseball over hockey
2017-11-01 19:40:27,+A to @Shawhelp great customer service
2017-11-01 19:35:08,anything now? I'd like to get this fixed
2017-11-01 19:34:57,I got it back by connecting to my 5Ghz connection. Maybe just too much interference tonight.
2017-11-01 19:34:24,Sent!
2017-11-01 19:33:52,Frustrating
2017-11-01 19:33:36,Shaw should turn on SN 360 for all Edmonton customers for the game?
2017-11-01 19:30:26,not sure why I have sent it twice and I don;t' really want to put all my private information on here
2017-11-01 19:29:55,But you could @Sportsnet that your client base is less than happy!
2017-11-01 19:29:03,Same issue as everyone else here. What an absolute joke.
2017-11-01 19:27:17,@Shawhelp are you heading of any outages downtown Calgary? No internet here.
2017-11-01 19:25:17,that's crooked. Just stop fishing for money as a company and fix it.
2017-11-01 19:24:16,"@Shawhelp Thank you, Shaw. The non-functioning wi-fi near Starbucks, Broadmead Mall, Victoria, is now fixed!!! I can tweet again!"
2017-11-01 19:24:07,sent
2017-11-01 19:24:06,Thats great for people who have shaw360... however i don't..
2017-11-01 19:24:03,"I see that, but you want extra money for that channel. SO, I don’t have it !That is what is BS"
2017-11-01 19:23:43,Disappointed-don't have SN360-premium.The #EDMvsPIT game was listed as being on my basic service-SN1. Listening on @630CHED -gr8 announcers
2017-11-01 19:23:27,How can you make a god that is Nate Coehoorn dm you for help?!? Just give the man his SN360!!
2017-11-01 19:22:19,"I don’t subscribe to this channel, so now I can’t watch it? Ridiculous. SN360 never has Oilers games on it. @Shawhelp @Sportsnet"
2017-11-01 19:20:00,"Also others are able to get the game in SD on 121 without subscription, but we don't."
2017-11-01 19:19:16,Still doesn't make sense they're showing plays of the month over current gameplay on Sportsnet One.
2017-11-01 19:14:45,@Shawhelp what channel is the pens oilers game?? It's all baseball
2017-11-01 19:14:07,"When channels r sampled for subscription it’s free for a wknd, can this work for the game? Will it be replayed?"
2017-11-01 19:14:02,@Shawhelp why is the TV guide saying that the @EdmontonOilers are playing on sportsnet1 yet there a poker game on??
2017-11-01 19:13:26,"@Shawhelp I have no phone service, my phone says check tel line, whats up?"
2017-11-01 19:13:25,This is BS. meanwhile I can watch plays if the month??? WTF.
2017-11-01 19:13:08,"Ok, thanks"
2017-11-01 19:11:39,Best two players in the league being bumped off the cable feeds onto a subscription only channel.
2017-11-01 19:07:14,It's listed on channel 159 sportsnet1 @RogersHelps you've angered many of hockey fans
2017-11-01 19:04:39,That is garbage... put the premiere game of the week on a premium channel. Guess this is why I'm cutting the cord.
2017-11-01 19:04:36,@Shawhelp if you don't fix the oilers game on shaw your about to lose 1million peoples business...
2017-11-01 19:02:28,You do realize that it's Crosby vs McDavid and that that's more important than poker and baseball to the majority of Canadians right?
2017-11-01 19:02:14,@Shawhelp so you guys moved the oilers game to a channel I’m not subscribed to. Not happy and I think I’m done with Shaw.
2017-11-01 19:00:58,How do you guys not have the hockey game available in HD?
2017-11-01 19:00:01,No difference.
2017-11-01 18:56:18,Bullshit!!
2017-11-01 18:55:28,@Shawhelp @Sportsnet What channel is the Oilers game on tonight? All of the channels that list Oilers Vs Pens have poker or the World Series
2017-11-01 18:52:34,It's not there. Just bars. And there's no blackout as it's in SNW ON REG CABLE. This is not satisfactory as I pay for Free range.
2017-11-01 18:51:36,Thanks!
2017-11-01 18:50:49,@Shawhelp https:// twitter.com/jaycole1977/st atus/925887701772935168 …
2017-11-01 18:49:12,REPEAT. WHERE IS IT ON FREE RANGE???
2017-11-01 18:48:18,"My cable guide is wrong. Trying to find the Oilers game, and every channel it says it should be on is just baseball."
2017-11-01 18:47:51,"@Shawhelp so I know the oilers game is on SN360, but I don't have those channels! Will the game be on the normal channels after poker?"
2017-11-01 18:46:30,Thx!
2017-11-01 18:46:28,I finally found it on 121 which is listed poker!! Baseball is on the xhannels@listed for hockey
2017-11-01 18:46:11,@Shawhelp I don’t get 360 it’s in a different package. When I signed up I was told I would get all the oiler games...
2017-11-01 18:45:41,@Shawhelp @EdmontonOilers hey where's the @OilersNation game on SHAW
2017-11-01 18:45:36,I don’t have a channel 231. I have hockey central and whole@package but that channel is not on my listings
2017-11-01 18:42:40,"Found it, thanks!"
2017-11-01 18:41:37,@Shawhelp what channel is Sportsnet 360 in Edmonton?
2017-11-01 18:37:57,@Shawhelp where is the oilers game #oil country
2017-11-01 18:36:46,@Shawhelp It says Pittsburgh vs Oilers on two @Sportsnet channels. No Oilers game. I'm watching baseball and poker. What gives?
2017-11-01 18:32:12,"Three channels showed it listed... SNW, SN1 and SN360 per guide"
2017-11-01 18:28:12,@Shawhelp @EdmontonOilers which channel is the game actually on? #oilers #notbaseball
2017-11-01 18:07:30,@Shawhelp On cable u have @oilers @Sportsnet West. On Free range World Series is on that channel and oilers nowhere? Clarify?
2017-11-01 18:07:10,"Well the guide is wrong, particularly the Sportsnet channels"
2017-11-01 18:03:16,"@Shawhelp I know you have the website but I don't even know where to start with all the errors on my guide, particularly Sportsnet"
2017-11-01 17:56:37,You're a beaut! Thanks
2017-11-01 17:55:33,great and thnx.
2017-11-01 17:52:02,@Shawhelp what channel is the Canucks game on (Ladysmith)?
2017-11-01 17:43:37,At least I get a reply from you. Form Sportsnet though? Effen crickets
2017-11-01 17:38:52,Inconvenience? I have to miss one of the biggest games in the NHL this season because of MLB. Why can’t the MLB game be on360? Jerk move!
2017-11-01 17:25:16,I went home for supper and back to work. Ran out of time
2017-11-01 17:25:10,Yeah thnx I know that. Glad you finally got the memo.
2017-11-01 17:24:18,Last minute? The game has been scheduled for months lol
2017-11-01 17:20:09,I’m not home. What do you think setting recordings are for?
2017-11-01 17:11:29,"Well that’s just perfect, I can’t set my recording now. Thanks for that!"
2017-11-01 17:07:07,@Shawhelp internet just got disconnected. Doesn’t seem to work. Saskatoon east side area. Plz help. Thanks.
2017-11-01 17:04:44,I have Bluesky. Those channels don’t make sense. It doesn’t even show
2017-11-01 16:58:06,@Shawhelp set a recording for the oilers game on SNETW. The schedule is still there but the guide showing the baseball game. WTF?!
2017-11-01 16:31:36,"Everything works great, thanks guys!"
2017-11-01 16:25:42,Just sent a simple message to see if u get it now
2017-11-01 16:15:19,Sent a message but internet not working well either so not sure you got info - please let me know - thx

2017-10-31 13:45:18,They said they’ll message him back. It’s frustrating
2017-10-31 13:12:54,"@Shawhelp Internet has been 50% speed for several days. Have rebooted modem, changed channel, etc. Online support chat is broken. Help?"

2017-10-31 10:55:56,So it turns the audio back on when I change it to English but I have to do it every time I flip to the channel? It was fine a few days ago
2017-10-31 10:49:29,Hi Lance! We have another box. It says ARRIS on it.

2017-10-29 08:05:21,@Shawhelp what should the settings be at when I go into the online site to change the channel or 2.4g / 5g settings?
2017-10-29 08:04:20,Morning!! Any help on how to open our Blue Sky remote to change the batteries?? Nothing feels natural and I don't want to force it open
2017-10-29 08:04:05,Pretty sure you work at a media hub and could multitask that one
2017-10-29 08:03:28,@Shawhelp Speedtest shows all is good but my iPhone is having trouble. Seems slow loading twitter page or Facebook page. Something isn’t rt
2017-10-29 08:01:59,@Shawhelp wifi in my house is wonky. Keeps switching from 2.4g to 5g connections. I’ve unplugged everything and started over but same issue
2017-10-29 02:09:50,@Shawhelp is there an issue in the Rocky Mountain House Area in Alberta?
2017-10-28 22:18:55,I made sure it worked . My ppv is working. It cost me $60 to find that out
2017-10-28 22:17:50,So tech wouldn't help. So I just spent $60 on a ppv I didn't want just to make sure I could have people over next week for ufc217
2017-10-28 22:16:04,UFC 216 played for 5 seconds. 1 tech told me to call when a another Ppv was on and they would activate it to ensure it was working.
2017-10-28 21:11:54,@Shawhelp any further updates?
2017-10-28 20:23:16,@Shawhelp Fisher Cres no cable or internet either.
2017-10-28 20:17:42,"Thanks, done"
2017-10-28 20:04:55,@Shawhelp no cable internet or phone confederation park area
2017-10-28 19:44:15,Must be a glitch in my Safari- am on beta. Sea Monkey ( Mozilla?) worked just fine.
2017-10-28 18:26:13,You too and thanks again.
2017-10-28 18:23:52,That would be great
2017-10-28 18:22:11,Wifi is back :-)
2017-10-28 18:21:08,Thanks for the quick response.
2017-10-28 18:15:49,@Shawhelp if I live in an area that only supports Shaw Internet 75 speeds could I still get the 150 package just for the unlimited data?
2017-10-28 18:11:51,I will let you know if it works
2017-10-28 18:09:55,Yup. Thanks
2017-10-28 18:07:01,Not yet. Unable to reset as I'm in a wheelchair and can't reach the box. Waiting for a friend to come by
2017-10-28 18:02:12,Shaw at home

2017-10-28 17:23:44,@Shawhelp Just spent 7.5 hours waiting and trying to get bluesky tv installed. Still not working.
2017-10-28 16:40:33,You will say maintenance like you did to others. Why are we paying full price for an entire week of this near nonexistence internet.
2017-10-28 16:31:48,@Shawhelp get your shit together if you can't provide me with the service I'm paying for then let me out of this shitty contract.
2017-10-28 16:09:49,"@Shawhelp what's the cost to replace a bluesky remote - I don't need to, (YET) but I have a puppy. I'm careful w/ it, but he's...adventurous"
2017-10-28 15:51:36,It solved it. Thanks
2017-10-28 15:41:16,@Shawhelp ...is there a problem accessing accounts? All I'm getting is spinorama ..... pic.twitter.com/KlRhNknyl8

2017-10-28 14:23:56,@Shawhelp We have no sound with cable right now. Sound works fine with Netflix & TMN. Any ideas?
2017-10-28 13:46:24,@Shawhelp The Internet 150 and Large TV bundle is $164.90/month for existing customers for 2 years?
2017-10-28 12:58:59,@Shawhelp Really Well Done on the festive Halloween goodies on the Frame Channel from the Female in the House
2017-10-28 10:53:18,Thanks! It is odd it’s missing. Wife & I look forward to Ep3!
2017-10-28 10:01:14,@Shawhelp just got BlueskyTV installed and now my AppleTV doesn't work. What gives?!

2017-10-28 06:19:29,@Shawhelp Need an update on if a tech will fix the only phone service of my 75yrs old mom living alone before the weekend is out. 1/2
2017-10-28 02:44:31,@shawhelp any plans to compensate customers for ridiculous service from maintenance every single night for an entire week???
2017-10-27 22:37:29,I'm in Abbotsford
2017-10-27 22:37:15,Power cycled my devices as well as modem & stb

2017-10-27 22:05:07,@Shawhelp #highriver shaw outage in high river :( luckily I still had some downloaded Netflix shows! Btw any estimated time for the fix???
2017-10-27 21:07:13,It’s not the bloody remote it’s your whole shitty bluesky platform. Customer for many many years with several accounts. This takes the cake.
2017-10-27 20:58:31,@ShawInfo #blueskytv #fail #sucks pay for VOD and get buffering pic.twitter.com/PP0M0mTt3J
2017-10-27 20:56:54,Now the movie we rented from Shaw VOD pauses/freezes/buffers!!! AWFUL PRODUCT
2017-10-27 20:48:47,All we do is run around and reset TV boxes which is horribly inconvenient and frustrating.
2017-10-27 20:47:45,"System is overall glitchy, laggy and plain horrible. Takes 3-4 tries for voice commands to work. You should NOT be putting this in customer’s houses!"
2017-10-27 20:40:40,@Shawhelp There’s nothing to do in Thompson without internet. Please fix it before I’m forced to do something productive. SOS!!!
2017-10-27 20:24:40,thanks. i will. i just don’t like not getting hd versions on these awesome bluesky boxes while the channels are hd in the freerange app.
2017-10-27 20:14:32,"Okay so it's CMT, NBC that's doing it."
2017-10-27 20:12:03,The whole channel glitches and stops.
2017-10-27 20:10:21,Sure. Brb.
2017-10-27 20:10:08,"Don't see it on http:// zap2it.com . Its not a team, it's a preview show...guess @TSN_Sports isn't showing it this week @CollegeGameDay"
2017-10-27 20:09:42,@Shawhelp hey it’s almost 2018. why aren’t all the channels in HD?
2017-10-27 20:08:25,Nope! Just the one
2017-10-27 20:02:30,@Shawhelp CMT has sound for 3 seconds and then cuts out. It's fine on other tvs. What can I do?

2017-10-27 17:00:54,"@Shawhelp Congrats #ShawCable , you have lost a 16 yr loyal customer for both tv and internet due to absolutely awful customer service."
2017-10-27 16:58:36,Yes this is wifi for sure.

2017-10-27 15:52:55,@Shawhelp the only way to get any service from Shaw is to tweet about their bullshit #ShawSucks
2017-10-27 15:52:05,@Shawhelp shaw only cares until you move and cancel services. they dont care about loyalty ! #ShawSucks
2017-10-27 15:50:12,@Shawhelp i was wrong to delete previous tweet #ShawSucks after all

2017-10-26 20:50:18,But I've been using it since free range came out. As its handy to have when wanting to watch a canucks game at the dinner table.
2017-10-26 20:49:19,"Yes, I'm logging in with my account info. It just says add account and then it will take up to 24 hours to activate."

2017-10-25 19:14:40,I don’t think that’s the problem. Wired speeds aren’t that much faster than wireless. Thanks though.
2017-10-25 19:13:30,"Alas, that’s not the case. Wired speeds are only slightly faster at 47.65 mbps."
2017-10-25 19:12:08,"Ah, I see. Good point. Connection speed looks around the same for both."
2017-10-25 19:10:30,"Over wifi. Haven’t tried a wired connection lately. But most of our internet devices are wifi, so that’s what I care about most."
2017-10-25 19:08:27,No. Still around 43 mbps.
2017-10-25 19:06:18,Yes. Did you just reset the modem? The modem appears to have reset itself.
2017-10-25 19:00:33,Thanks. Would the Shaw Cable signal have cut out when I unplugged the modem?
2017-10-25 18:58:21,Just unplugged for about 45 seconds & plugged back in. Let’s see what happens.
2017-10-25 18:56:57,Thank you!
2017-10-25 18:54:42,I will try in a bit. I recently upgraded from internet 30 to internet 75. Maybe something wasn’t changed over correctly?
2017-10-25 18:52:55,"Just tested a wired connection. Slightly faster, but not by much. 42.32 mbps."
2017-10-25 18:46:32,@Shawhelp I’m currently paying for 75 mbps of internet service. Why am I getting less than 30? pic.twitter.com/f5hEuaoUbm
2017-10-25 18:26:38,It worked. Sorry I bothered you!
2017-10-25 18:24:47,Turned off the modem. It’s coming back now. Give me a minute. I’ll let you know if it worked!
2017-10-25 18:22:16,@Shawhelp I had internet and cable hooked up today and it appears that my WiFi isn’t working. Please help.

2017-10-11 08:11:41,"@Shawhelp Hi, I'm getting an intermittent internet connection (it was also down late last night)."
2017-10-11 01:14:28,@shawhelp would love to know why your stupid STBs take forever to change stations if you turn them on just after midnight....
2017-10-10 23:16:27,@Shawhelp suddenly our net cut out Saskatoon. Connect no net.tried restart. All devices no net.
2017-10-10 23:14:42,"@Shawhelp @ShawInfo Very happy to report, as I said I would, that Shaw came through for me today. Install done. Thank you!"
2017-10-10 22:36:35,He now knows how to stream it.
2017-10-10 22:32:52,"Oh sorry, you said does not"
2017-10-10 22:31:03,How do I log into that?
2017-10-10 22:28:06,"302 won't work, 326 does and has the game, (He had no idea he had the channel but is happy.) Pls check your help line and thanks."
2017-10-10 22:25:37,@Shawhelp why is the Canucks game blacked out in Victoria?
2017-10-10 22:22:55,@Shawhelp We are asking support if our NHL GameCenter subscription allows us to watch games online. They are sending us to DAZN?!
2017-10-10 22:14:40,We couldn't agree more here in Nelson.
2017-10-10 22:03:25,Still nothing
2017-10-10 21:53:17,Everything else plug into the power bar works. It just shows orange light online. No green for power.
2017-10-10 21:44:17,"@Shawhelp hi, I think I need a new modem. Got home and no lights on it. Power is on."
2017-10-10 21:09:42,@Shawhelp net is down again any idea??
2017-10-10 20:56:03,@Shawhelp hey peoples. Can you look into some connections issues at my friends place? I can dm you the address and room number.
2017-10-10 20:37:59,"Yes, I am watching on 302. Just thought you might like to know what is happening on 223. Thanks for the help."
2017-10-10 20:32:48,I'm having the same problem. Why wouldn't you guys just put the game on 223 since there's literally nothing playing on that channel.
2017-10-10 20:31:57,It has been messed up by the rainout of the baseball game. But SN says it should be on pacific but all I see there is this. pic.twitter.com/L58C5gjreY
2017-10-10 20:29:26,@Shawhelp My 79yo landlord your customer wants to know what cable service shows Canuck games in the interior of BC? You don't.
2017-10-10 20:29:19,Found it. What not on 223 SNP?
2017-10-10 20:27:44,@Shawhelp Fun trick you have going with the help line just be a loop and never talking to a rep. but I had a question...
2017-10-10 20:15:41,"@Shawhelp Hey Help-Friends... Any suggestions for when my channels get glitchy? Canucks game on 302 is hard to watch, 245 is unwatchable."
2017-10-10 20:08:43,@Shawhelp : what channel is the @Canucks game in #Vancouver ??
2017-10-10 19:58:32,Yes we are! Thank you for the update. It seems to be working but still a bit slow. We will continue to check for updates! Thank you.
2017-10-10 19:49:54,@Shawhelp are there currently any outages in downtown Calgary? We are having some issues with our internet. Let us know! Thanks
2017-10-10 19:47:04,@Shawhelp HI! My tv says signal loss detected and I tried resetting the box. Is there anything else I can do?
2017-10-10 19:33:25,@Shawhelp Wi-Fi outage in Squamish? Modem s flashing away happily- poor fool - but connection says no internet. Like maybe I hadnt noticed

2017-10-10 18:59:35,"@Shawhelp are you currently experiencing outages in Fruitvale, BC area? No WiFi service and have powered modem off a few times."
2017-10-10 18:55:45,@Shawhelp cable isn't working. Got this message. Help! pic.twitter.com/FS5PbAPI4F
2017-10-10 18:40:49,"@Shawhelp I'm super frustrated with Shaw service, more specifically,lack there of right now. Day 2 of no wifi at home and I'm not impressed!"
2017-10-10 18:35:47,So it's still listed as PPV even if you have Sportsnet One? It is a little confusing
2017-10-10 18:27:54,yeah. thanks
2017-10-10 18:24:00,I wasn’t sure if that was a retail location.
2017-10-10 18:18:46,@Shawhelp I’m looking to trade in a remote that isn’t working. Do you know if i can do that at the west edmonton building? (10450 178 St NW)
2017-10-10 18:03:02,I only have the 1!
2017-10-10 18:00:48,Same outlet
2017-10-10 17:52:17,@Shawhelp is NHL centre ice still available? If so cost?
2017-10-10 17:50:42,"@Shawhelp internet down again, and cable spotty. third time in the last month, getting pretty frustrated with this!"
2017-10-10 17:41:51,I could use some help....I can't figure out if the world is round or flat? What's the real answer so I can set the record straight
2017-10-10 16:51:54,I think we figured it out - unplugged power bar for router. Thank you for your speedy reply though! Appreciate it : )
2017-10-10 16:46:49,Is the internet and cable down in Airdrie? Or just me?
2017-10-10 16:43:41,@Shawhelp sitting on hold for 45 minutes is the definition of poor customer service.
2017-10-10 16:34:54,No response from Telus yet. I'll wait for a bit longer then start the DM process.
2017-10-10 15:43:40,You're welcome!!!!!
2017-10-10 15:40:17,God bless Lance. You get one free ticket to the gloryhole.
2017-10-10 15:23:53,@Shawhelp are any channels showing Peru vs Colombia? Even PPV?
2017-10-10 14:07:58,"Lol didn't want to reply to me eh? Because I called you guys out on your nonsense. Okay. BTW, internet cutting out all day today. Good job. pic.twitter.com/rqITeKKzVC"
2017-10-10 13:57:54,@Shawhelp how can i find out what time my install was supposed to be i thought it was 11am-1pm but it is now 1pm so i may be wrong
2017-10-10 13:46:46,"@Shawhelp apparently calling customer service is useless. No help, just blame."
2017-10-10 13:30:42,I don't have time for troubleshooting. But this an ongoing issue. I'll have to muddle thru unhappily today and deal with it another day.
2017-10-10 13:13:22,"@Shawhelp I've had to unplug and plug my modem now THREE times today (once more than usual haha sob). What's going on, Shaw?"
2017-10-10 13:09:22,@Shawhelp I'm having lots of internet interruptions today. I'm downtown. Are there issues?

2017-10-10 10:32:43,@Shawhelp Maybe skip the endless up-sell while I am waiting on hold for tech support already. Not feeling the need to add more Shaw now.
2017-10-10 10:29:13,"Just using Shaw's (a ""Hitron"")."

2017-10-09 20:34:26,@Shawhelp hi! I don't see the Canucks game on TV except for PPV? 302? What gives?
2017-10-09 19:31:29,Thanks Ken.. User error here. It's listed on 304 and 327 as well but blacked out. 350 is good. Didn't scroll up far enough!

2017-10-09 17:55:16,@Shawhelp Is it possible for you to check my internet connection? There have been dropouts in connectivity the last couple of weeks.
2017-10-09 17:50:02,"Thanks, just unplugged and plugged in. Working now"

2017-10-09 09:56:09,@Shawhelp I come on here when things are bad but things have been great for a long time and you deserve thanks when things are good too.
2017-10-09 09:46:03,@Shawhelp trying to reset my password on web and your sight refuses to email me the reset request. Whats going on?
2017-10-09 09:20:41,Good morning

2017-10-08 22:06:10,"Okay…. Well, I’ve set up the series recording again, and will see what happens."
2017-10-08 22:00:26,"I can delete the series, sure. Not sure about ‘ensuring it chooses the HD feed’ part. Ch 271 is the HD channel for Space."
2017-10-08 21:54:09,Seems to have happened every week that show has been on. All the other recordings on other channels have been fine.
2017-10-08 21:47:47,The only series recording I currently have active on Space is Star Trek Discovery.
2017-10-08 21:43:44,Still “identifying”
2017-10-08 21:43:31,Nothing yet. L
2017-10-08 21:42:33,@Shawhelp Any idea why my gateway box messes up recording Space like this? Smaller picture within a box. It’s only Ch 271 (V2X postcode) pic.twitter.com/fLl5hUQibZ
2017-10-08 21:40:18,Done just waiting for the lights to all come back on.
2017-10-08 21:36:26,Like I’m trying to log into 192.168.0.1 and get an unreachable address error.
2017-10-08 21:33:33,Sure ummm been awhile how?
2017-10-08 21:31:40,Not just wireless - my gaming laptop in the basement is actually hardwired.
2017-10-08 21:31:19,Hard wire also down
2017-10-08 21:31:12,Was fine up until about half an hour ago
2017-10-08 21:30:54,Restarted it which usually helps but no go
2017-10-08 21:30:35,All 7 lights are solid from power all the way down to 5ghz
2017-10-08 21:26:19,Is Shaw down in NW #yyc tonight?
2017-10-08 20:44:51,"I like this service. Even though it's not working yet, I like that there's an attempt as we DM back and forth! Well done, Shaw"
2017-10-08 20:10:55,The No Content message is mounted on a black screen with the 1-888-472-2222 number to call if it persists. 35 minutes since I noted.
2017-10-08 20:09:12,"The error screen ""NO CONTENT"" I'm in the Shuswap of BC, if that matters?"
2017-10-08 19:18:16,Yes - me too.

2017-10-08 17:04:31,@Shawhelp getting only 0.7 mbps download in your wide open 150 plan pic.twitter.com/nBXv9vcq2T
2017-10-08 16:39:52,@Shawhelp - Last year we could watch Madam Secretary on your demand function. Very annoying to find we can’t do this anymore.....grrr
2017-10-08 16:02:48,Is it pro-rated or still $200 for the season. Not offering it from day 1 is 1 of the dumbest things I've ever seen!
2017-10-08 15:53:53,Pmed
2017-10-08 15:49:29,@Shawhelp are you getting back NFL Sunday ticket?
2017-10-08 15:13:06,@Shawhelp Hey Shaw! Where can I go to replace my TV remote in Calgary?
2017-10-08 15:02:22,Thank you so much for your help May. Have a Happy Thanksgiving
2017-10-08 15:02:17,"21, 23 are fine (no 22) as are 56, 57."
2017-10-08 14:56:15,"@Shawhelp HBO/TMN/TMN Encore channels have very pixelated pictures. What's up? I'm in YWG, west of river."
2017-10-08 13:55:14,@Shawhelp Just sent a DM needing some help. Thanks in advance
2017-10-08 13:51:13,"Thnx, Lance. I could do that, OR, when you find out you could let me know"
2017-10-08 13:44:25,"Do you ever publish the name of the recipients? Is do, would be happy to retweet!"
2017-10-08 12:29:20,"True.. but Redzone is what really matters for Fantasy Football, Sunday ticket is a bit of a waste"
2017-10-08 11:44:28,Fair. Well I'll wait till Friday/Saturday and hopefully there's a solution by then. If not I might be downgrading haha. Thanks.
2017-10-08 11:41:47,Will try unplug
2017-10-08 11:41:37,Yes all channels and all pvr recordings
2017-10-08 11:40:35,It's like a cruel taunt. Now. I'm stuck using the awful DAZN app for another week
2017-10-08 11:40:12,I get that. But seems strange that everyone but blue sky customers can get it. Lol. Especially since I can see the channels on my guide.
2017-10-08 11:35:01,Next weekend? Ouch. Hopefully it's ready by next Sunday. Starting to regret getting blue sky if that's the case...
2017-10-08 11:35:00,@Shawhelp just got new box and now the channels live/ pvr temp freeze then jumps ahead to where it currently is.
2017-10-08 11:34:09,Probably looked something like this pic.twitter.com/qPBguqHJRo
2017-10-08 11:32:23,@Shawhelp hey guys are we able to get nfl Sunday ticket yet for Blue sky customers?
2017-10-08 11:31:45,"@Shawhelp added Treehouse for my 5 yr old. Was told it was HD, it’s not. Why no HD? The ‘other’ company has it in HD..."
2017-10-08 10:38:58,"I understand why you want to go DM. But, I would like to let those also know whom follow me that you have fixed this issue."
2017-10-08 10:31:02,This needs attention. Can't tether from@phines all day. Shouldn't have touched this if there wasn't a solution. Very frustrating.
2017-10-08 10:30:10,Did that. The modem goes to switch and then to house. Still not working. Need this fixed ASAP. We all are tethering from phones. $$$$

2017-10-08 08:08:09,How did you manage that? DAZN paid big money for NFL rights
2017-10-08 07:23:09,@Shawhelp having some internet issues - internet disconnects and have to reboot modem a few times a week. Any ideas?
2017-10-07 23:24:25,@Shawhelp will shaw be offering NFL Redzone again?
2017-10-07 23:10:56,"@Shawhelp ever since switching from Shaw direct to Shaw blue sky nothing but crap. Less Channels, always skips or pauses and pvr loops"
2017-10-07 21:08:11,@Shawhelp can I get Red Zone added to my cable now? DAZN said to contact you guys.
2017-10-07 20:23:07,"Doesn't work with wifi or LTE. Checking my IP address, it says i'm in Sechelt, BC. SNET streaming works on SNET-now, but not Freerange?"

2017-10-07 19:59:58,@Shawhelp this is the 3rd game in a row the previous game has bled into the flyers time slot. Could you not put it on another channel?

2017-10-06 16:12:09,Guys I have played your channel request game before (NFL in HD) and it took 4 years ... its a scam; is Rogers holding you hostage?

2017-09-23 17:10:07,I'm hard wired via Ethernet. The router is operating as usual. Internet works for 3-5 minutes at a time then drops completely.
2017-09-23 16:53:10,Both.
2017-09-23 16:47:32,@Shawhelp your hirton router really is junk. I shouldn't have to restart it everyday to fix connection issues.
2017-09-23 16:33:38,@Shawhelp some of my channels go all Pixelated and the sound cuts out...cant even watch the channel. Why is that
2017-09-23 16:23:19,@Shawhelp Just a Question Are Residential Homes Getting IPV6 Service With Shaw 150
2017-09-23 14:33:04,@Shawhelp for BlueSky how do we get the show we are watching to appear when guide is displayed
2017-09-23 14:31:47,Its both. Same as last weekend. We just want to play games on our days off and keep getting dropped. Before you ask yes we've power cycled
2017-09-23 14:24:55,@Shawhelp this is two weekends in a row that our shaw150 internet has been spiking and cutting in and out. What is going on?
2017-09-23 14:22:59,Not a common thing I presume? Lol
2017-09-23 14:22:37,Yes they do
2017-09-23 14:18:37,Yes. It's the wifi actually that we lose (lost twice) and comes back. It's no biggie but never lost internet/wifi before unless pwr outage
2017-09-23 13:42:52,Direct

2017-09-20 18:38:42,@Shawhelp @FoodNetworkCA oye so this weeks Guys Superstar eppy 4 is actually eppy 3. guys whats going on? labelled 4? but really 3? lame!
2017-09-20 18:33:30,"@Shawhelp . So... @EdmontonOilers / @NHLJets game is blacked out, in #Calgary , but the game is not on any other channels? Channel 351."
2017-09-20 18:31:33,"But shouldn't the game be available through centre ice, which is the ppv channels?"
2017-09-20 18:19:50,Not your fault. Thanks for letting me know
2017-09-20 18:17:01,"Yeah I double checked, Oilers tweeted out that todays game and the Saturday one should have had the blackout lifted..."
2017-09-20 18:14:32,"Not for me. For some reason I get TSN 1, 2, 4, & 5. But TSN 3 ""The scheduled program is not available in your region""."
2017-09-20 18:12:40,"No I'm in Edmonton, TSN Jets local coverage is blacked out, gotta use Center Ice. Honestly I'm just assuming the free preview for CI is on"
2017-09-20 18:12:33,I am in Edmonton. 183 says blacked out and 238 is not a channel I get. 351 says blacked out too
2017-09-20 18:11:39,"Nope it says blacked out too, only showing in Winnipeg region lol."
2017-09-20 18:05:43,@Shawhelp The Oilers Jets game was supposed to be on Center ice according to the Oilers but is showing blacked out...?

2017-09-20 17:29:47,@Shawhelp I unplugged my DVR as I couldn't get VOD service. Now it is saying DVR service is unavailable. How long does it take 2 restore?
2017-09-20 17:28:37,@ShawHelp Service in my area has been crap since some maintenance/upgrades a month+ ago. High latency or complete disconnects regularly.

2017-09-19 14:25:29,"That's great to hear. Is there a limit? 1 has broken buttons and frustrating to use. 2nd one is less broken, so lower priority to replace."
2017-09-19 14:18:24,I've heard in past that if you brought in your broken pvr remote Shaw would replace for free. Still true or do I have to buy replacement?

2017-09-08 11:50:20,I am the sole reason you are losing some customers I am telling everyone to stay away from you guys.
2017-09-08 11:42:14,Love the remote but not having a skip button sucks
2017-09-08 11:21:48,@Shawhelp Why is my internet running so slowly is it a problem on your end? The last 12 hrs have been brutal!
2017-09-08 10:49:56,"Up yours we always have problems with our gateway and no one can ever come in and fix it we always have to wait multiple days, worst ever."
2017-09-08 10:03:44,"I also had 4 drops for a minute or two on the evening of the 6th. Anything that can be done, or are you guys having network issues? Annoying"
2017-09-08 09:55:43,Drop was over an hour - did 2 hard resets with no change. Gave up and went to bed and it was working in morning. 9:45ish pm drop.
2017-09-08 09:51:23,Had blinking green home lights
2017-09-08 08:52:53,It's fixed now. Must have been a glitch.
2017-09-08 08:36:52,Lol you realize I am Donut deprived
2017-09-08 08:34:47,It's not that the hotspots don't work. It's just the continual attempting to connect and then losing the connection when I've walked past
2017-09-08 08:34:05,Yes. If I stay in one spot I'll connect. It seems like by the time my phone connects I've walked past the hotspot
2017-09-08 08:31:07,"I just notice it walking downtown because there's so many wifi spots, my phone seems to always be trying to connect to"
2017-09-08 08:22:48,Good Morning and hopefully you all have a good Day but first get Coffee into yourselves
2017-09-08 08:13:45,"Hello my friend, can you talk to the @NFL and get Sunday ticket back please. We are all suffering"
2017-09-08 07:43:27,"@Shawhelp why no ""skip"" 30seconds button on new Bluesky remote?! That's a step back not being able to skip commercials"
2017-09-08 07:15:51,"@Shawhelp Channel 220 was CNN, guide says it still is, but E! show is on in SD. Where is CNN?"
2017-09-07 22:12:34,"Thanks for the response. Can't win tonight I guess, @DAZN_CA shit the bed on coverage and @NFLRedZone isn't offered #nfl #daznfail"
2017-09-07 21:21:57,@Shawhelp You wait 'til the start of @NFL season stating you can't honour @NFLRedZone we ordered #shameful #badservice #whodat @Saints
2017-09-07 20:34:59,@Shawhelp I have blue sky tv. Just bought a new tv. How do I reprogram the remote for the new tv?

2017-09-07 20:14:33,"@Shawhelp I'm thinking of upgrading from internet15 to internet 75 for a few months. If I do, can I go back to internet 15? Is there a fee"
2017-09-07 20:00:54,@Shawhelp Why are we getting a show on Laci Peterson when we record Leah Remini?
2017-09-07 19:57:03,Cheers dude. The ship has sailed.

2017-09-07 19:40:28,@Shawhelp Hi is cable down in Calgary? Just getting a no signal message.
2017-09-07 19:37:30,@Shawhelp September 12th Netflix will integrate with bluskyTV
2017-09-07 19:14:47,"@Shawhelp wonderful tech support, thanks :)"
2017-09-07 19:10:31,Just after I sent that tweet it was all good again. Thanks
2017-09-07 19:09:44,Sorry my wife accidentally unplugged the router...
2017-09-07 19:06:59,@Shawhelp are there connection problems in Winnipeg?
2017-09-07 18:26:48,@Shawhelp I noticed that the Shaw-Go-Wifi is really slow. I had to turn off my wifi to end my parking session. I was in the beltline.
2017-09-07 18:16:07,Is there a list of everything I should have when bringing back devices like this?
2017-09-07 17:59:31,"Thanks for responding, if you can provide feedback upstream, it is laughable that you're marketing a servive that you can't provide specs on"
2017-09-07 17:51:40,@Shawhelp If I'm going to connect a wireless router to my modem do I need to change any settings in it?
2017-09-07 17:49:43,It says 80+ channels. So someone made a list and counted at some point.
2017-09-07 17:48:57,So when I'm shopping for cable tv packages there is no way to know of which channels will be available on the go? Ads suggest it's not all
2017-09-07 17:42:29,@Shawhelp I'm looking to find a list that shows what cable tv channels are also available on #freerangetv
2017-09-07 17:42:24,@Shawhelp any network issues atm? My receiver has rebooted on it's own twice in last 10 min
2017-09-07 17:40:14,@Shawhelp where in wpg do I return my cable box and phone box if I am cancelling services?
2017-09-07 17:12:12,@Shawhelp I just wanted to let you guys know I'm very happy with my service. The person I dealt with on the phone last week was great.
2017-09-07 16:45:40,That's right. I found that was much less painless on campus than the other options. Will the team be back at UBC tomorrow?
2017-09-07 16:34:04,"@Shawhelp I missed the Shaw team on UBC campus in Vancouver yesterday, and today they are nowhere to be found. Back on Friday?"
2017-09-07 16:17:04,"Loooking to disconnect services, was told I had to call it in."
2017-09-07 15:28:17,@Shawhelp hey u shaw 150 is maxing out at 92mbps dl and 16.37 up
2017-09-07 14:15:37,"@Shawhelp it was assumed that I would just ""drop off my internet modem"" but y'all got a 20 person line up... that or 100$ installation fee"
2017-09-07 14:10:51,"Noooo Internet. Nadda. Nuthin. Apparently, though, 250 reports were filed since 1pm about Shaw being down! I've got company, it seems."
2017-09-07 13:30:32,done
2017-09-07 13:17:39,so will it be fixed? :)
2017-09-07 13:09:11,every single live channel

2017-08-31 21:16:50,"@Shawhelp requested call back 2 hours ago, supposed 2 b within 30-45mins, never received one. I called back & have been on hold for 30mins"
2017-08-31 21:03:02,If only the other hundred thousand people didn't use it at the same time then it's be fast. Oh well. Sacrifices must be made
2017-08-31 20:58:44,"@Shawhelp psstttt hey guys, thanks for the free WiFi @PNE_Playland . No data overage fees for this guy!"
2017-08-31 20:14:41,"Thank you. And, the internet connection is so slow! We were told it would be a lot faster. It is noticeably slower... not noticeably fast"
2017-08-31 19:44:10,It worked the other day yes... but this is a daily occurrence since upgrading our service. Is this to be expected now?
2017-08-31 19:33:07,"Yep but shouldn't have to.-doesn't address the fundamental issue-happens daily at the same time. Doing nothing, will work in 15 minutes."
2017-08-31 19:27:45,Done that. I shouldn't have to do this daily! Which has been the case since we upgraded... not impressed. Thought the bugs had been sorted
2017-08-31 19:19:38,at least 50 people here wish you could too. Please credit my account for the time I've spent here @$50/hour. Thanks.

2017-08-30 19:02:46,"I guess if u could train your call centre not to be robot, would be a good start"

2017-08-30 18:23:02,"Okay, thanks"
2017-08-30 18:18:39,I would like a lower bill. $150/mo is a bit excessive when I was paying $119 in June. Lol
2017-08-30 18:18:17,Good. How can one check their package? Does shaw offer package deals? We're giving serious thought to going to a competitor
2017-08-30 18:09:05,Okay. Checked this out https://www. shaw.ca/television/new s-and-free-previews/ … and assumed they were going

2017-08-30 17:51:41,There's fashionably late and there's this guy. Actually if you could ask the SHAW Corp to act with an iota of integrity that would be super.
2017-08-30 17:48:20,@Shawhelp hi. Any global issues around Barlow Trail? Our internet at Executive Royal Hotel has slowed to a crawl
2017-08-30 17:47:31,"That was my mistake I was looking at 272, thanks for clearing that up"

2017-08-30 15:23:29,@Shawhelp could you dm me
2017-08-30 14:41:34,"ok. I don't buy that at all. But also, BlueSky boxes are all Digital/HD output. So what market are you trying to placate with SD output?"
2017-08-30 14:36:18,so you have NO PLANS to upgrade SD channels? Ever?
2017-08-30 14:30:23,@Shawhelp when are the BlueSky channels going to be all in HD? It's pretty weird that in 2017 you are broadcasting so many SD channels.
2017-08-30 14:26:28,"Aaand just like that, Internet order submitted. Thanks for your quick responses!"

2017-08-29 21:13:38,@Shawhelp Just checked your tweets from the fight night and there are tons of tweets about glitching.. Why am i being lied to and hung up on
2017-08-29 21:12:34,@Shawhelp I was on the phone with support and they claim that there were no reported signal glitches or freezing.

2017-08-29 20:42:02,"Not just for this recording, happens with others/intermittently. This series recorded fine last week, did this same thing the week before"

2017-08-29 19:07:34,I'm not to sure about that. I should have asked if there was a network problem first.
2017-08-29 18:36:00,@Shawhelp Is it possible to suspend cable service for a period of time while still using internet?

2017-08-29 17:25:53,Thank You. It might be a router issue. Seems to be working again.
2017-08-29 17:21:53,"@Shawhelp are you having issues in Victoria? Internet went down about 15 minutes ago. Rebooted everything, still nothing."
2017-08-29 16:30:03,@Shawhelp Is the Wifi Network down in Fleetwood?! There seems to be interference.

2017-08-29 16:15:55,@Shawhelp Are there NO reasonably priced internet plans for lower income people anymore? 5Mbps for $60 is ridiculous.

2017-08-29 15:09:13,@Shawhelp why is it that when I want a new service my call is answered in 2 mins & when I want to disconnect I'm on hold for 1h & counting??
2017-08-29 14:54:26,hopefully he is now getting the assistance/support that he needs (and more than a little frustrating for a costumer switching service...)
2017-08-29 14:49:12,"@Shawhelp hey - you've had a tech out my house for almost 3 hours - he could use a little more help authorizing BlueSky box, just saying..."

2017-08-28 19:12:08,@Shawhelp did the internet just go down in Westside Vancouver?
2017-08-28 18:29:12,Screen is black for every channel/ no sound. Guide still works.
2017-08-28 17:36:08,"Should that channel always show up, or only when there's something to be broadcasted? I have SN1 but can't seem to find SNFlames."

2017-08-28 14:51:42,@Shawhelp I don't really need help as much as I want to let you guys know that ShawOpen sucks. Thanks for letting me get that off my chest.

2017-08-28 10:52:03,Ethernet
2017-08-28 10:47:11,@Shawhelp Slow speeds all weekend. I usually do speed tests and get around 50mbps. Webpages are so slow loading @only 11.53 mbps.
2017-08-28 10:39:07,I have a question. Please dm me
2017-08-28 10:22:10,"Yup, just rebooted and now it's working again. Puzzling."

2017-08-28 06:58:41,@Shawhelp I am wondering if someone is working.
2017-08-28 06:36:10,@Shawhelp our cable is out
2017-08-28 00:30:20,Email address which only required the name before the @. A Shaw ID would require an entire email address. Is the Shaw I'd becoming mandatory
2017-08-28 00:26:11,I started to create one but it said that would deactivate the main Shaw login so I did not activate. I usually authenticate with a Shaw 1/2
2017-08-27 23:07:52,"then the flash thing pops up, i have the latest flash and added it. so im at a lose 2/2"
2017-08-27 23:07:03,"I have done that, and every time I click on free range it says ""now connecting to your entertainment experience"" 1/2"
2017-08-27 23:05:24,Which works for a couple months then the same issues reoccur time and time again.
2017-08-27 23:04:55,"In the 4 years I've been with you guys, I've had a tech come out every 4-5 months to ""fix"" stuff when all that happens is swapping coax."
2017-08-27 23:02:02,I'm more or less tweeting this to let people know about the continuous poor QoS. And I'll be switching providers when my term is up.
2017-08-27 23:00:57,"It's not my house or location, I've been assured that many times. It's your mediocre equipment and poor tech resolution."
2017-08-27 22:59:55,And every time I call into tech support it's always something that requires a tech to come out.
2017-08-27 22:59:17,I used to work for a satellite TV/Internet installation company so everything you've said I've done more than enough times.

2017-08-26 21:35:26,Yes - do not bill me for product i didnt receive.
2017-08-26 21:33:34,"It's all good now, I power cycled the modem a couple times and that worked."
2017-08-26 21:26:08,It ended up working 5 minutes after I said something. Thanks though!
2017-08-26 21:25:15,@Shawhelp how do I see the fight? I can't find it on Shaw on demand
2017-08-26 21:22:11,Just DM you
2017-08-26 21:16:55,Is it because we are in a specific area
2017-08-26 21:16:24,We already tried that and didn't work yet!
2017-08-26 21:12:20,Sent
2017-08-26 21:10:45,It basically says the federal right and rules about watching the game. But we already purchased it
2017-08-26 21:07:44,Yup twice
2017-08-26 21:07:28,We actually finally got through on the phone and it's fixed now. Thanks!
2017-08-26 21:06:30,@Shawhelp 2 hours later and I finally get to watch the fight. $100 well spent......
2017-08-26 21:03:44,Thanks we unplugged and reset both the main gateway and the portal and that worked.
2017-08-26 20:59:23,All good - thanks for the follow up!
2017-08-26 20:56:41,@Shawhelp why isn't the fight working between mayweather&mccgregor in Winnipeg?!
2017-08-26 20:55:00,When we try to tune to 300 it pops up the menu with the 'watch' option but clicking that just takes us to a black screen.
2017-08-26 20:52:06,Figured it out. The purchase didn't go through on your end apparently according to the phone support person. Thanks.
2017-08-26 20:50:34,@Shawhelp please help me !! I've ordered the PPV and still have no signal almost 2 hours in !!!!
2017-08-26 20:47:09,Thanks - but I'm pretty sure the issue is with @UFC .
2017-08-26 20:46:58,"038-0530-2431. We were recording it, I wonder if that had anything to do with it."
2017-08-26 20:46:31,I mimic all the frustration of this current thread. Sad day for fight fans.
2017-08-26 20:45:07,"Switched to MTS, all good thanks anyway"
2017-08-26 20:44:05,Reset the gateway and the Portals. Nothing.
2017-08-26 20:44:04,"Had twitter support from Richard, up and running now. Lost an hour."
2017-08-26 20:39:06,Waiting for an hour and a half to get through and the fight still isn't on the tv due to technical difficulty... ANSWER THE PHONE PLEASE!!
2017-08-26 20:38:07,You'll look it over? I will not pay.
2017-08-26 20:35:50,Anybody else's ppv commentary in french
2017-08-26 20:35:10,"@Shawhelp Accidentally bought fight in SD, wanted HD- possible to fix?"
2017-08-26 20:30:52,Did that a long time ago. Everyone here to watch left to watch at neighbourhood pub. I trust we wont be billed now that its 8:30??

2017-08-26 20:21:43,"@Shawhelp We've reset, unplugged, ordered three times and we still can't get the fight. This is ridiculous."

2017-08-26 20:17:31,"@Shawhelp Purchased the fight, and we got a French version of it instead. We don't speak French. Please help!"
2017-08-26 20:17:20,Ok thanks. Spent 2 hours on the phone today and over an hour yesterday. It's causing challenges to my home business for sure!
2017-08-26 20:10:46,Sorry @Shawhelp we've tried that several times. Have disconnected and reconnected the Gateway several times.
2017-08-26 20:05:37,"That worked, thank you!!"

2017-08-26 19:57:21,@Shawhelp I presume we will not be charged for the PPV fight we ordered & cant watch? Where is the support st $99/ purchase?
2017-08-26 19:57:19,@Shawhelp hey - can't seem to purchase the fight? Tried unplugging it the box. No go. Help!

2017-08-26 19:13:04,@Shawhelp the internet just went down at my house in South Surrey. Is there an outage or should I call tech support?
2017-08-26 19:11:52,I have been on hold for a few hours
2017-08-26 19:11:13,"Seems to be fine on space, cbc news, and komo4 hd. Not sure about other sd channels. Ytv seems ok though."

2017-08-26 19:04:49,"@Shawhelp are there any issues with the fight, I ordered it but it froze at 1 second in the countdown."
2017-08-26 19:04:14,Still seems to be happening. It's happening on BBC news and pbs Detroit wtvs. Picture seems to have no issues but sound gets choppy
2017-08-26 19:04:04,Now I have a screen that shows the boxers and it says Coming Up Next
2017-08-26 19:03:34,@Shawhelp hi! We've been on hold for over an hour to order the fight on pay per view. Why the long wait? #thanks !
2017-08-26 19:02:23,It's 7:02 - just have a black screen
2017-08-26 18:53:14,@Shawhelp I can't see channel 300 to order the fight.
2017-08-26 18:45:07,@shawhelp getting audio issues on non hd channels right now in Burnaby. Any reported issues?
2017-08-26 18:05:50,Ok..
2017-08-26 17:27:36,@Shawhelp Has there been any Internet issues in Prince George or is it just me ? Rebooting routers not fixing it- no net or phone.
2017-08-26 17:24:32,@Shawhelp Awesome!!! More cell phone overages thanks to no wifi. #EatShitChoppyWifi pic.twitter.com/CITPHTrFuB
2017-08-26 17:16:07,"No offense, but that's just stupid. It should be a feature that is unlocked w/ the subscription. (You can have that idea. Now run w/ it. )"
2017-08-26 16:43:50,"Speaking of which, how come my @WWENetwork doesn't have the OnDemand option? Shaw jipped me of the free mon. Gonna jip me of OnDemand, too?"
2017-08-26 16:39:49,Not the end of the world. Just sucks that it's not included in the On Demand.
2017-08-26 16:39:36,@Shawhelp my Shaw box froze up randomly and now just says no IP. I've rebooted four or five times now. What else can I do?
2017-08-26 15:40:24,Not going to pay money to support a racist and a woman-beater fighting for $130 million. Overpaid wastes of skin.
2017-08-26 15:36:20,@Shawhelp hi! Can I cancel my service by going to a Shaw Kiosk (say Oakridge mall)?
2017-08-26 15:31:11,"Have to DM ya later. While new PVR is dropping programs, life must go on."
2017-08-26 15:27:42,I collide the same way for a non existent parking spot
2017-08-26 15:23:23,Gets my downvote!
2017-08-26 15:09:23,"@Shawhelp However, the ""new"" (refurbished) PVR has already omitted one of my programmed recordings. Does all of your equipment suck?!"
2017-08-26 15:08:18,"@Shawhelp I got the new (refurbished) PVR y'all sent me. Like it, though it's taking some getting used to."
2017-08-26 14:48:19,You guys ready for the Maywather V McGregor fight?

2017-08-25 23:23:21,Hi. I ended up talking to your tech support on the phone and I guess I can't be helped right now because of your system maintenance
2017-08-25 22:42:09,@Shawhelp I was messaging with you last night and now have another issues - can I just send another DM? Thanks
2017-08-25 22:34:39,@Shawhelp Is there an internet outage for the Bridgeland/ Renfrew area in Calgary?

2017-08-25 20:03:16,Lost service too. Must be an outage?
2017-08-25 20:00:32,@Shawhelp hey there! Our tv and internet just stopped working in wood buffalo neighbourhood in Fort mcmurray - planned outage?
2017-08-25 19:42:12,Yes and it sounds like they just believe that I gave my password to my modem to someone. Going dm... ok
2017-08-25 19:36:11,@Shawhelp I am sick to my stomach. When I checked usage today shows more than 300 gb used in one day. Its impossible. 1/2
2017-08-25 19:19:00,I will give this a try
2017-08-25 19:17:57,It does seem to be hd channels.
2017-08-25 18:45:35,"@Shawhelp internet goes down at least once a month with shaw, never have issues with @TELUS @TELUSsupport at my other place. Garbage."

2017-08-25 14:37:50,@Shawhelp hey guys. Curious if you've received my payment yet? I posted it late Wednesday from OLB.
2017-08-25 13:57:44,thank you :) frustration might be forcing our hand in the fall!
2017-08-25 13:43:00,"Honestly, this is not very good customer service."
2017-08-25 13:39:33,Can you tell them to hurry up at answer my phone call? It is almost an hour now.
2017-08-25 13:30:03,"@Shawhelp It is coming up on 50 minutes now, this is ridiculous."

2017-08-25 13:16:49,@Shawhelp my phone support agent was amazing. I didn't get her name. If I DM deets can you ck my file and send commendation to her manager?
2017-08-25 13:08:29,"@Shawhelp I have been on hold for over 25 minutes now, are that many people really trying to cancel your services right now?"

2017-08-25 11:07:31,"Thank you for letting me know, hopefully it is up and running soon."
2017-08-25 10:53:28,"@Shawhelp do you have any outages reported for Calgary, all of the sudden the modem cannot get online."
2017-08-25 10:40:25,"Trust me, if you guys had service in the area you would have tons of clients. I've already spoken with Business services about it. Thanks."
2017-08-25 09:42:41,"@Shawhelp are you guys having outages for Internet in Langley, bc?"
2017-08-25 09:40:12,"Thankfully since the box talks, it'll announce if descriptive video available and I'll just selected for each time I want to watch it."
2017-08-25 09:32:26,Will that do any good if my city is in the heat of the outage map?
2017-08-25 09:24:04,@Shawhelp you guys are bullshit we don't pay you hundreds for wifi that only works sometimes fix that shit fr
2017-08-25 09:20:58,"Correct, but it shouldn't turn off recorded commentary of a sports event"
2017-08-25 09:15:58,"Would get the Odd commercial audio, then game no commentary. Thought golf channel was down."
2017-08-25 09:13:56,I thought the golf channel wasn't working. I was getting descriptive video on other channels
2017-08-25 09:12:46,That wouldn't work as I couldn't read it anyways
2017-08-25 08:44:43,Done :). Thank you
2017-08-25 08:40:05,Did that last night. Was working this morning and went out again at 6:45. I've left home now. Will try resetting again tonight.

2017-08-20 20:48:26,It's just internet traffic that is routing properly.
2017-08-20 20:48:09,Not possible. Would require a whole lot of network changes to get things connected. I use passthrough local traffic is running properly

2017-08-20 14:44:32,Constantly having troubles my wifi is done for the 4th day in a row and the only way to fix it is to call in and be on hold for 10 mins

2017-08-20 13:20:10,"Much appreciated! I'd buy you tim Hortons if I could, have a good day!"
2017-08-20 13:09:19,Shaws request line is a sham.. you guys give HD options for crap like Hifi and Love Nature.. but not NFL. What's your retention number?
2017-08-20 12:52:18,You services are brutal...absolutely brutal. More like Shaw 150kbps
2017-08-20 12:50:38,This internet is brutal and I'm sick of calling every 2 days to get everything working. This is brutal Shaw. Absolutely brutal...

2017-08-20 12:26:28,"@Shawhelp I hope there's a plan for airing as many NFL games as possible, I will never switch to some streaming service. RedZone was great."

2017-08-19 12:51:57,@Shawhelp has there been any issues in Winnipeg regarding speed? I'm paying for 150 and seem to be getting 35-40
2017-08-19 12:00:27,"Yes, but my point is that these licensing agreements should move & improve w the times & embrace bingeing! Watching from beginning is fun!"

2017-08-18 22:11:43,"@Shawhelp Wow, 2 minutes into Live Realtime with Bill Maher, you lose the signal? I hate to say it, but this is why I cancelled HBO before."

2017-08-18 17:20:01,Thanks I don't know who makes these calls but Shaw should be talking to Bell about getting more since they claim to be showing all NFL games
2017-08-18 17:18:05,Do you know when you'll find out? Season starts in three weeks.
2017-08-18 17:15:45,"@Shawhelp @ShawInfo Quick question, are you gaining access to more CTV channels on your guide for the football season?"
2017-08-18 17:14:54,@Shawhelp Bell is offering EVERY NFL game on Sunday through their timeshift package. Will you guys be doing the same?

2017-08-18 12:53:24,"@Shawhelp , You need to integrate your #BlueSkyTV accounts with your other accounts. 20 minutes repeating info to the Rep(s) is obnoxious"

2017-08-18 12:22:27,"I mean, the first step is getting my name correctly, Harvey. Will be messaging shortly."

2017-08-18 09:10:35,Shaw did not even give them administrative access to this gear.
2017-08-18 09:09:52,This has happened to two of my clients because you talked them into it. They had no idea what you setup until i visited.

2017-08-17 22:41:25,@Shawhelp Hello! Suddenly I can't find Game of Thrones in the VOD HBOCanafa section. Thought I did before. Where are the series? Thanks!
2017-08-17 22:21:13,@Shawhelp Will you be timeshifting to cover all NFL games as a work around to DAZN as Bell has advertised they will be?
2017-08-17 21:45:02,"@Shawhelp are you having a problem with devices trying to connect? If I switch between routers I've got a 50/50 of ""connected no internet""."
2017-08-17 21:03:20,"Wi-Fi. Internet 75. Nothing has been tried, appletv and our phones/tabs/comp worked great last week before Shaw came here to ""upgrade"" us."
2017-08-17 20:56:36,"@shawhelp How is that after you ""upgrade"" us to 3x faster internet, it's the slowest internet I've had in years? #dialupwasfaster #nonetflix"
2017-08-17 20:24:07,"Lol well played, but after more years than we can count we are leaving @Shawhelp due to poor service and lack of appreciation. #breakingup"
2017-08-17 20:08:45,That’s ok. Tired of waiting for someone to respond.
2017-08-17 20:06:01,@Shawhelp Can someone contact me to discuss my services? I’m not interested in talking to someone who is helping others at the same time.
2017-08-17 19:46:20,Sure thing.
2017-08-17 19:44:17,Do you guys give out t-shirts or caps to streamers?
2017-08-17 19:30:20,Wall jack
2017-08-17 19:26:07,I would but Shaw on Demand is working on the Motorola now. It should work ALL THE TIME.
2017-08-17 19:20:04,If it was called Shaw Mobile everyone would switch including me
2017-08-17 19:15:18,Hi Ken! I haven't. It it would be nice if it was called Shaw Mobile
2017-08-17 19:14:21,Motorola but I don't use the other one much

2017-08-17 17:44:17,High speed is an advertisement moniker? High speed is a descriptive term.
2017-08-17 17:43:15,"A supervisor already ""helped"" next stop consumer affairs. False advertising."
2017-08-17 17:42:46,@Shawhelp was on the phone with a supervisor saying the name of the package has nothing to do with the speed of the internet.
2017-08-17 17:41:56,@Shawhelp that's false advertising. Calling something high speed when it's not?
2017-08-17 17:40:22,"@Shawhelp been paying this ""high speed"" thought is was computer making it slow, get new computer, find out shaw is lying about its service"
2017-08-17 17:39:25,@Shawhelp also won't discount to any of the new plans because discount is only for new customers. We thought we had high speed internet
2017-08-17 17:13:01,K. Huge buzz right now as ppl in Canada not happy with #dazn so this is a great plan by Bell to combat
2017-08-17 17:07:07,@Shawhelp any plan to add more HD regional CTV feeds prior to @NFL season. @CTV_Television showing different games regionally this season.
2017-08-17 17:05:26,Bell now has 15 regional CTV channels in HD. They will show dif games in dif regions. That's how they will show all games
2017-08-17 16:56:54,@Shawhelp Is Shaw internet having issues at the moment? I've tried unplugging my router a bunch of times already and still no Internet.

2017-08-17 12:59:02,@Shawhelp how is the best way to watch NFL games now that Sunday ticket is gone?

2017-08-11 23:30:54,@Shawhelp I am getting tired of the almost daily interruptions to my internet and the router outputting at 10%
2017-08-11 21:34:20,Thank you for the help
2017-08-11 21:27:33,This is cruelty!
2017-08-11 20:52:10,"Yes, can I come back to you guys?! you were much nicer than Telus is terrible"
2017-08-11 20:42:07,@Shawhelp I've had 1-855-274-7429 call me 3 or 4 times. They never talk and just hang up when I answer. I see this is a Shaw #. What's up?

2017-08-11 20:33:20,5G if you can believe it
2017-08-11 20:31:23,"@Shawhelp somethings up with my internet, its been down most of today, kinda off and on. my parents are out of town as well."
2017-08-11 20:28:18,I can't afford more down time and time from work.
2017-08-11 20:25:34,Barely an apology from the other rep when I cancelled the upgrade. Now your reps want me to upgrade again requiring more modem shenanigans
2017-08-11 20:24:20,If I hadn't cancelled the upgrade we would have been without service and unable to work for 4-5 hours.
2017-08-11 20:23:05,CS rep shut off our service for a modem swap in the middle of the day. I was downtown with new modem while hubby was at home trying to work.
2017-08-11 18:53:59,@Shawhelp having so many issues with Shaw lately.. making me rethink a provider I've been with for years.
2017-08-11 18:46:24,I made my payment Aug 10. As per my bill. Now I am receiving bullying email. Seriously thing about dumping Shaw and switching to Telus.
2017-08-11 18:14:56,"Thanks, info has been sent!"
2017-08-11 17:35:47,@Shawhelp Shaw my bank takes 3 days to post payments. Bulling customers won't help. Talk to the banks for real-time payments. @CRTCeng
2017-08-11 15:03:09,Thanks.
2017-08-11 14:59:38,And not available for TV only?
2017-08-11 14:56:29,Isn't the Value Plan for internet only?
2017-08-11 14:04:24,"Hi Ken, modem is staying online. I am just going through my progressions before going out to buy a new router."
2017-08-11 14:01:59,Message sent!
2017-08-11 13:53:09,@Shawhelp if I have cancelled my services with shaw but have a credit outstanding will I get a cheque in the mail?
2017-08-11 13:34:11,"@shawhelp failed yet again. Had install appt from 9-11, it's now 12:30 and we get a call saying it's cancelled. Day wasted. Telus = better"
2017-08-11 13:18:33,"Honestly, if I don't get a call in the next 5 mins I'm having my boyfriend call and talk to Bell MTS."
2017-08-11 13:15:38,"If you care to help, please have someone from Loyalty call me immediately."
2017-08-11 13:15:22,Your other Twitter rep refused to help & attempted to obtain confidential identification from me via Twitter which is unacceptable.
2017-08-11 13:14:51,I want Shaw to recognize my continued loyalty and lower my monthly internet rate. $90 is insane & I can get a better price at @Bell_MTSHelps
2017-08-11 13:12:44,I was able to talk to someone on the phone. Thanks.
2017-08-11 13:03:36,Phil can you DM me a number and we can start this process

2017-08-11 10:17:15,Think they've gotten wise to that - today it was from a +44 (UK) number.
2017-08-11 10:12:40,Wow that is crazy. Thanks for the info.
2017-08-11 10:09:54,"@Shawhelp Any way to block incoming calls from foreign countries? So tired of ""Windows Support"" calling me"
2017-08-11 10:06:37,Are you for real? How do I get to watch it then?
2017-08-11 09:33:27,I had no idea you had that. Thank you!
2017-08-11 08:45:00,@Shawhelp Question for you. I have an existing account with a 2yr 150 plan. Would I be eligible for student pricing during 2nd year?

2017-08-10 23:12:09,"Was paying my cable bill, there were more people turning in cable boxes and wifi modems. You raise your prices to boot? #SinkingShip"
2017-08-10 22:01:13,"@Shawhelp fyi guide is listing ""Nashville on the Road"" instead of @NashvilleCMT 's finale on @w_network - my pvr wasn't gonna record it"
2017-08-10 21:30:48,Thank you!
2017-08-10 21:28:22,@Shawhelp the play button on my over remote has failed - how do I get a replacement?
2017-08-10 21:05:43,already done.
2017-08-10 21:02:44,@Shawhelp Why do I bother paying u for internet if it always goes down? Sending this tweet using my data while sitting 1 ft from ur router..
2017-08-10 20:53:42,@Shawhelp Can't connect to 5G at home - is this a bigger problem or just me?
2017-08-10 20:12:20,It's a signal frequency issue that happens occasionally.
2017-08-10 20:10:54,"@Shawhelp hey. Gateway owner here. Was supposed to start a free promotion HBO, Movie Central. Nothing working at my end now"
2017-08-10 20:09:13,It's general wind issue. I don't have buried cable line.
2017-08-10 19:21:52,I had to DM you my tweet was too long. Sorry.
2017-08-10 19:08:18,Have a great week(end)!
2017-08-10 18:44:09,"@Shawhelp What channel is the Hallmark network on in North Vancouver? ""W""??"
